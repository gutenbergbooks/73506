PREFACE
</p>

<p>
These pages are mainly concerned with men
and women who, in days gone by, have done
my wife and me the honour to sit at our table,
and have now left us.  I think of their Empty
Chairs from a warm corner of my heart: their
friendship has brightened my life and stored
my mind with rosemary.
</p>

<p>
Having already written <i>Recollections</i>, I am
bound to repeat myself, so let me plead
forgiveness for the besetting sin of advanced
years.
</p>

<p>
My apology for the book is its last chapter.

<h3>
I
<br><br>
KING EDWARD VII
</h3>

<p class="t3">
"Blessed are the peacemakers"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
All who were born, as I was, in 1841 must
count it an honour to have come into the world
in the same year as King Edward the
Peacemaker.  And the honour appeals especially
perhaps to one who owes many of his friends
and much of his happiness to the stage, for
the stage has never found among Royal heads
a firmer friend than was the late King; his
gracious words and acts went far to conquer
a decaying prejudice.
</p>

<p>
The first time that either my wife or I met
or had speech with the Prince of Wales (as
he was for many years) was so far back as in
1868, when he, with the present Queen
Alexandra, attended an early performance of one
of Robertson's comedies during our managerial
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
career at the old Prince of Wales's Theatre
(which he had graciously given his permission,
through the Lord Chamberlain, to name after
him).  On this occasion the Prince came for
the first time behind the scenes, and honoured
our little green-room with a visit.  His love
of exactitude in all matters of costume enabled
us then, I remember, to correct a slight error
in a military uniform.
</p>

<p>
His Royal Highness was accompanied by
Frederic Leighton, then young and handsome,
who ten years later was elected President of
the Royal Academy; and by Carlo Pellegrini,
whose caricatures, bearing the now historic
signature "Ape," were then attracting
both attention and admiration.  The
celebrated "originals," I imagine, have now all
passed away.  Lord Chaplin was the last
survivor of the unpublished "set" which
enrich the Marlborough Club.
</p>

<p>
The weather was foggy, and during the
performance became so dense that at the close
the streets were dangerous.  The Royal
carriages, after great difficulty, arrived safely,
surrounded by a body of police, bearing
torches, who escorted our visitors to
Marlborough House.  In all the years of our
management the Prince never came again
without asking, upon his arrival, to be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
informed at which interval it would be
convenient for my wife to receive his visit to the
green-room.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A domestic drama
</span>
</p>

<p>
One of these visits to our theatre caused,
indirectly, the plot of a domestic drama.
</p>

<p>
The Royal box was constructed by throwing
two private boxes into one, and on a certain
Friday night news reached the theatre that it
was required by the Prince for the following
evening.  This was before the days of
telephones.  Both boxes had been taken&mdash;one at
the theatre, the other at a librarian's in Bond
Street&mdash;and nothing remained unlet but a
small box on the top tier.  Not to disappoint
the Prince of Wales, it was decided that every
effort should be made to arrange matters.  The
box which had been sold at the theatre was
kindly given up by the purchaser, and a visit
to Bond Street fortunately disclosed the name
of the possessor of the other.  The gentleman
was a stockbroker; so a messenger was at
once sent to his office in the City, only to find
that he had just gone.  After a great deal of
difficulty our invincible messenger succeeded
in learning his private address, where, on
arrival, he was told that "Master went to
Liverpool on business this morning, and won't
be back till Monday."
</p>

<p>
The door of a room leading from the hall
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
was opened at this moment, and a portly lady
appeared upon the scene.
</p>

<p>
"Went to Liverpool!" echoed the messenger.
"Nonsense!  He's going to the Prince
of Wales's Theatre this evening."
</p>

<p>
The lady now approached, and asked if she
could be of any service.  The messenger
repeated his story and stated his errand.  The
lady smiled blandly, and said that, if the small
box on the upper tier were reserved, matters
no doubt would be amicably arranged in the
evening, and so that man went away rejoicing.
</p>

<p>
At night, not long before the play began, the
gentleman who had in vain been sought so
urgently arrived in high spirits, accompanied
by a lady, handsome but not portly.  When
the circumstances were explained to him, he
agreed to use the smaller, and upstairs box.
</p>

<p>
There ended our share in the transaction;
but hardly were the unfortunate man and his
attractive companion left alone than the portly
lady reached the theatre and asked to be
shown to Box X.  She was conducted there;
the door was opened.  Tableau!  What
explanation was given as to the business trip to
Liverpool we never knew, or whether the
third act of this domestic drama was
afterwards played at the Law Courts before "the
President."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Grave illness
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was in the winter of 1871 that the Prince
fell seriously ill from typhoid fever.  The
national excitement reached so high a pitch
and the craving for the latest news of his
condition grew so great, that the bulletins
from Sandringham were read out in the theatres
between the acts, and the National Anthem
and "God Bless the Prince of Wales" were
nightly played by the various orchestras.
</p>

<p>
The Prince was hardly expected to survive
from hour to hour, but when reassuring
bulletins were issued I vividly remember the
relief they caused.  The extraordinary
manifestation of loyalty to the Throne and
attachment to the Prince which this illness set ablaze
culminated on the day of General Thanksgiving,
when London was <i>en fête</i>, and Queen
Victoria, with her convalescent son, went to
the service held at St. Paul's.  My wife and I
were fortunate in being invited by the Lord
Chamberlain to represent the stage&mdash;young
managers as we then were&mdash;at the Cathedral.
I shall never forget the effect when the great
west door was thrown open and a loud voice
announced "The Queen."  The imposing
ceremony, the aspect of the building, with its
splendid assemblage of people, have only since
been equalled at the Jubilee Thanksgiving of
1887 in Westminster Abbey, at which we were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
also present.  On the day which followed I
remember being at the corner of Pall Mall and
St. James's Street while the decorations were
being taken down.  I said to a police constable:
"You fellows must have had a long and very
tiring day, yesterday."  "Yes, sir, we had,"
the man replied, "and we'd willingly go through
it all for her again to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
I also recall an amusing incident which took
place at that time in the grounds of Chelsea
Hospital.  There was a parade of the old
Pensioners, looking as if they had stepped from
the canvas of Herkomer's "Last Muster."  The
Prince and Princess of Wales, with other Royalties,
including the Duchess of Teck, who was in
a bath-chair, passed along the line, the Prince
in his kindly way stopping now and then to say
a pleasant word.  The breast of one old man
was ablaze with medals&mdash;the Prince handled
them and said: "You have indeed seen a deal
of service, my man."  The old fellow drew
himself up, saluted, and answered: "Yes,
your wusshup!"  The Prince controlled his
amusement at the new title and passed
along, but, as she was drawn after him in
her chair, the Duchess did not repress the
merry laughter for which she was loved by all
sorts of people.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Dinners to actors
</span>
</p>

<p>
Among my treasured memories is that of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
the dinner given by the Prince at Marlborough
House to the principal actors of London&mdash;one
of the many acts by which he endeared himself
to the theatrical profession.  On this occasion
I was honoured by being placed on the right-hand
of our host.  This was in 1882.  Without
having realised it, I found that I had already
been the senior manager in London for some
years.  Thirty-eight were at table, the actors
present being Henry Irving, J. L. Toole, John
Hare, Charles Wyndham, Charles Coghlan,
W. H. Kendal, John Clayton, David James,
Arthur Cecil, Henry Neville, Lionel Brough,
Hermann Vezin, George Grossmith the elder,
and myself.  H. J. Byron was invited, but
serious illness kept him away.  I am the only
survivor of that happy company.  Of the
guests invited to meet us, Lord Lincolnshire
(then known to his intimates as "Charlie
Carington") alone is with us still.  Lord
Knollys, a charming guest, the trusted
servant of three monarchs, and Sir Dighton
Probyn, for so many years Queen Alexandra's
devoted henchman, have both recently gone
from us.
</p>

<p>
The Prince gave a similar dinner a year or
two later at the Marlborough Club, and also
honoured the actors by accepting an invitation
to dine with them at the Garrick.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
</p>

<p>
During an interval in a performance of
Robertson's comedy, <i>Ours</i>, at the Haymarket
Theatre, I was conducting the Prince to the
green-room, when, on crossing the stage, there
was a congested condition of some scenery.
I turned to our master-carpenter, whose name
chanced to be Oliver Wales, and said, "Which
way, Wales?"  I realised the effect of the
words by an amused look on the Prince's face.
My wife on that evening had taken her autograph
book to the theatre to ask the Prince to
add his name to it; he wrote at once, "Not
'<i>Ours</i>,' but Yours sincerely, EDWARD P."
</p>

<p>
My wife and I were naturally proud of the
personal interest taken by King Edward in the
farewell performance which we gave on our
retiring from management in 1885.  The Prince
(as he still then was) suggested the date, in
order that with the Princess of Wales he might
be present.  They were accompanied by the
three young princesses.
</p>

<p>
On November 9th, 1891, some of the leading
actors, including Hare and myself&mdash;Irving was
in America at the time&mdash;went to Sandringham
as a deputation, to present H.R.H. on his
fiftieth birthday with a cigar and cigarette box,
in gold, with the feathers mounted in brilliants,
the gift of members of the theatrical
profession.  The Prince was greatly pleased with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
what was really a handsome present, and, to
my knowledge, he never missed an opportunity,
when the box was placed by his order in front
of him after dinner, to say what it was and
who gave it.  On the occasion, after a happy
luncheon, we were, as was customary, I was
told, weighed in the hall, much to the
annoyance of one of the party, who had a
superstitious objection to the proceeding.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Alone in the storm
</span>
</p>

<p>
London was visited by violent blizzards in
March 1892.  On an afternoon in that month
I determined to go out and face one of the
worst of them.  I dressed for the enterprise,
and as the door of our house&mdash;then in Berkeley
Square&mdash;was opened for me, a solitary
pedestrian passed the portico, wearing a black
Inverness cape and, with difficulty, holding up an
umbrella.  In spite of the driving sleet and
snow I could not help noticing a remarkable
resemblance borne by the passer-by, who was
walking towards Piccadilly, to the Prince of
Wales.  I followed at short distance, and was
more and more surprised by what I thought
must be a striking "double."  At the corner
of Hay Hill the pedestrian stopped, turned
round, stared at me as I was slowly approaching,
and after some hesitation trudged on down
Berkeley Street.  By this time I felt certain
it must be the Prince, so I crossed the road and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
continued my walk by the side of the wall
enclosing the gardens of Lord Lansdowne and
the Duke of Devonshire.  As I reached the
passage which divides them, the Prince again
stopped and looked at me; he then crossed
the slushy road with the evident intention of
speaking.  I advanced towards him.  The
Prince begged me to put on my hat and walked
with me to the pavement I had left; he stood
there and spoke of the recent death of the
Duke of Clarence, of the grave illness of
Prince Louis of Hesse, of the disastrous fire
at Sandringham; since when, he said, according
to an old superstition, he had known no
luck, adding that he was starting that evening
with the Princess for the south of France and
a stay at Cap Martin, that meanwhile "he did
not know what to do with himself, as they
were so steeped in sorrow."  After some
minutes I said that I must not keep him
standing longer in such weather.  The Prince then
shook me cordially by the hand, and said, very
simply, "I am so glad to have had this talk
with you."  He hesitated again as I left him,
then turned back and passed out of my sight
up Hay Hill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Visiting the sick
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the same day it chanced
that my wife and I had been invited to a
musical party given by Lady Londesborough.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
We took our places in a row of chairs; a few
minutes later the one next to mine was
occupied by the then Lord Wharncliffe, whom, as
Chairman of the Beefsteak Club and in other
ways, I knew.  He turned to me and said:
"Bancroft, if there is such a thing as a ghost,
I saw one this afternoon, for as I was slithering
down Hay Hill in a hansom, hanging on to
the doors through the dangerous condition of
the road, a man was walking on the pavement,
so like the Prince of Wales, that I instinctively
raised my hand to take off my hat, when I
remembered that it could only be some amazing
resemblance to the Prince, who never walks in
the streets alone."  I was able to convince
him that it had been no ghost.
</p>

<p>
A few weeks afterwards I went to Monte
Carlo.  On my arrival I heard that Arthur
Sullivan was lying very ill at Eze.  I went to
his villa on a broiling hot day, and was talking
under the verandah with his devoted nephew,
Herbert Sullivan, then a young fellow, when
the sound of a carriage stopping at the gate
was followed by the figure of a visitor walking
up the garden path alone.  I saw at once it
was the Prince of Wales, who, directly he came
close to us, greeted me with the words:
"Very different weather from when we last
met."  The Prince, among other kind acts,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
sent his own doctor to see the sufferer, who was
too ill to be allowed to receive anyone.
</p>

<p>
At that time I was much occupied by the
readings of Charles Dickens's <i>Christmas Carol</i>,
which I gave on behalf of hospitals.  A great
stimulus to their success was one of the many
acts of kindness which I have received from the
then Prince of Wales.  Soon after I started
them I had the good fortune to meet the
Prince, by the invitation of the late Lord
Burnham, at Hall Barn, where he was staying
for a shoot extending over several days.  The
Prince spoke to me warmly about the "Carol,"
and asked if I would like to give the reading
at Sandringham at the coming Christmas-time,
when the house would be full of guests.
Needless to say, I could have wished for no
greater help to any project that I had a
part in.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
At Sandringham
</span>
</p>

<p>
On my arrival at Sandringham I was met
by Sir Dighton Probyn.  We were soon joined
by my host, who took a personal interest in the
preparations for my evening's work.  In the
drawing-room, before dinner, I found among
the "house-party" two old friends, Sir Charles
du Plat and Sir Charles Hall.  On entering, the
Princess of Wales paused to look round the
room; she then left the Prince's arm, advanced
towards me, and most graciously welcomed me.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
At the table, also, were the present King and
Queen.  The audience for my reading was
completed by invitations given to many friends
and neighbours, the household, the tenants,
and the servants&mdash;the ballroom being full.
The reading was accompanied by laughter and
applause, a special tribute being paid to my
impromptu description of the memorable turkey
as "real Norfolk."  In the billiard-room, later
in the evening, I had suitable opportunity
to show the Prince the cigar-case which was
given to me by Queen Victoria at Balmoral,
saying that it was the first occasion on which
I had carried it.  The Prince at once replied,
suiting the action to the word, "Perhaps you
would like me to be the first to take a cigar
from it?"
</p>

<p>
When in 1897 the late Marquess of Salisbury
submitted to Queen Victoria that the honour
of Knighthood should be conferred upon me,
none of the many congratulations that my
wife and I received were more charmingly or
warmly expressed than those of the Prince of
Wales.
</p>

<p>
It was, however, at Marienbad, where King
Edward went annually to take the waters, that
he might be seen at his friendliest, free from the
cares of his high estate and able, as the "Duke
of Lancaster," to relax something of Royal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
ceremony; but, however unbending, the King
had great unconscious dignity.  Happy
luncheons and pleasant dinners have I enjoyed in
his company there, charmed by a perfect host,
put entirely at ease by his geniality and
constantly impressed by his wide knowledge and
deep interest in the affairs of the world.
Among fellow guests I may mention Pinero,
Tree, and Hawtrey.
</p>

<p>
The one exception to "Marienbad dress"
was when the King gave a dinner on the
fête-day of Francis Joseph, the old Emperor; then
the card bore the words, "Evening dress and
decorations."  I was honoured with an
invitation, and that year had no tail-coat with
me.  A soldier friend said if his decorations,
for which he had telegraphed, did not arrive
in time he would lend me his "tails."  After
luncheon, however, I bolted up to the
golf-course, hunted down Sir Edward Goschen's
attaché, a charming tall fellow, and, knowing
he would have to wear diplomatic uniform at
the dinner, asked if he would lend me his
ordinary evening coat.  On the night of the
ceremony the guests were assembled waiting
for the King, who went the round of the
half-circle with a happy word in several languages
to all.  His humorous salutation to me was,
"A very becoming coat, Bancroft."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
</p>

<p>
I recall an amusing incident told me by my
neighbour at table, who was High Sheriff of
his county.  At a ceremony which the King
had journeyed from London to perform, a
provincial Mayor, after being himself
presented, nervously said: "May I present Your
Majesty to the Mayoress?"  The King
immediately replied: "Certainly; the Mayoress
is generally presented to me, so it will be a
novelty."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
His love of precision
</span>
</p>

<p>
I have referred to King Edward's well-known
love of exactitude in matters of
etiquette and ceremony, and I remember a
curious instance of this quality.  On one
of the occasions when I was His Majesty's
guest, a discussion arose about the period of
some incident that had been mentioned in the
course of conversation; one of the guests said
that it took place early in the reign of Queen
Victoria.
</p>

<p>
"No," said our host, "you are mistaken; it
happened towards the close of the reign of the
late King."
</p>

<p>
Not for a moment or two did those present
realise that by "the late King" His Majesty
was referring to King William IV, who, sure
enough, was strictly "the late King," although
full seventy years had passed since the "sailor
King" sat on the throne of England, and he had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
died before anyone then at the table was
born.  I had occasion to notice also that King
Edward was always punctilious to give his
predecessors their Royal title.  Should anyone,
for instance, allude to "the statue of Charles I"
at Charing Cross, the King would be sure to
reply with a reference to "the statue of King
Charles I."
</p>

<p>
In 1909, the year of the King's last visit to
Marienbad, my memory for dates was appealed
to at His Majesty's table with regard to the
year of Lord Fisher's birth.  I answered that
the great little "Jacky" was born in the same
year as the King and, as it happened, myself.
This led to other names, all friends of our host,
being similarly mentioned.  I told the King
that I held the Royal vintage to be a good
one.  He was both amused and interested,
and wished the list of names to be made out
for him, adding: "I must ask you all to
dinner."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
His end
</span>
</p>

<p>
Alas, too soon afterwards came his death&mdash;a
national sorrow!  King Edward impressed
the world by his conduct on the throne, which
he filled greatly and with a great humanity
from the hour he was called to it.  He was
beloved by all sorts and conditions of men, who
felt that when he died they had lost a great
friend, the State a great servant, our country
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
a great King.  "The King is dead: long live
the King."
</p>

<p>
Of the present Prince of Wales it may be
truly said, in the words of Shakespeare:
"Thy noble grandfather doth live again in
thee."

It is a long cry back to 1878, when we had
Jenny Lind for our guest and we had the pleasure
of hearing her sing; there cannot be many
people living who have listened to a trill from
the throat of the "Swedish Nightingale."  My
wife and I first met her at Pontresina, where
she was staying with her husband&mdash;"Little
Otto," as we called Mr. Goldschmidt.  It is
difficult to describe that gifted creature&mdash;plain
in feature, insignificant in figure&mdash;until she
opened her lips: then everything changed&mdash;she
cast a spell round her and became idealised.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The black box
</span>
</p>

<p>
I remember, too, the humour with which the
great lady told and acted an amusing incident
that occurred on one of her travelling operatic
tours when she appeared at a different place
every evening.  This was not altogether lost;
my wife reproduced it afterwards.  All the
members of the company were seated in the
train except the tenor, a funny-looking little
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
fat man who stammered painfully when speaking,
but sang without a trace of his affliction.
Just on the point of starting he appeared in a
state of excitement at the door of the great
songstress's compartment, having discovered
that a large black box which contained her
wardrobe had been left behind.  He hurriedly
opened the door and stammered violently:
"Mad-ame, Mad-ame."  "Yes, yes."  The
poor tenor got a step further: "The b-b-b-b&mdash;"  The
bewildered lady cried, "What is it?
What's the matter?"  Still the afflicted tenor,
stammering more and more, could only answer,
"The b-b-b&mdash;&mdash;-"  "Yes, yes, yes, but what is
the b-b-b&mdash;, my dear fellow?"  The stammer
nearly choked the wretched creature as he
gasped, "The bl-bl-bl-bl&mdash;&mdash;"  "Sing it, sing it,
for mercy's sake, sing it!" cried the diva.  The
tenor lapsed dramatically into recitative: "All,
I fear, is lost!"  "Go on, go on.  What's
lost?"  "I fe-ar&mdash;is lost!"  "Go on, tell us,
go on, what's lost?"  The wretched tenor
struck an attitude as he sang, "The black
box!"  "Yes, yes, what about it?"  The
only answer was, "The black box!"  "What
of it, man?" cried the poor lady in despair.
The tenor reached his highest note as he
shrieked, "The black box has been
for-got-t-en!"  Jenny Lind fell back in her corner and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
muttered: "Great Heaven!  I shall have no
clothes!"
</p>

<p>
The whistle sounded, the tenor was hoisted
into his compartment, and the train started.
</p>

<p>
I recall another story of how when a great
composer&mdash;I think it was Meyerbeer&mdash;died, a
pushing musician sent a great musician
the score of a funeral march, which he had
written in honour of the illustrious man who
had passed away, with the hope that it might
be played at his burial, and asking for a candid
opinion of its merits.  He was rebuffed by a
judgment to the effect that things would
have shaped better had he himself died and
Meyerbeer undertaken to compose a funeral
march.
</p>

<p>
It is bewildering to contrast the modest fees
earned in Jenny Lind's day, and by gifted
creatures like Malibran, Grisi and Mario (the
pair sang in large houses for about thirty
guineas) with the fabulous figures reached by
such artists as Melba, Caruso and Paderewski
in recent times.
</p>

<p>
There is a pretty medallion of Jenny Lind
on the walls of Westminster Abbey, and I am
glad that a statue has now been erected to her
memory in the capital of her native land.
</p>

<p>
Another glorious songstress, Adelina Patti,
was our friend for many years.  She invited
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
us to stay at her Welsh castle, but we could not
go.  She amassed wealth and also charmed the
world longer than any of her rivals.  It has
been truly said that the harp-strings slumber
until touched by a magic hand: the echo of
her wonderful voice still beats in human hearts,
although its music has ended in the silence that
waits for us all.

<span class="sidenote">
"Sarah"
</span>
</p>

<p>
In this little chapter&mdash;devoted to honoured
women who have been our guests&mdash;mention
must be made of one so famed as Sarah Bernhardt,
the first actress to receive the Legion
d'Honneur.  My wife and I met her, and sat
by her side, at the Mansion House, the
occasion being a luncheon given by the then Lord
Mayor in 1879 to the members of the Comédie
Française, which comprised a group of players
no theatre then could equal or has ever equalled
since.  I recall an amusing incident which
occurred at the banquet concerning two busts&mdash;one
of Nelson, the other of Wellington&mdash;which
prominently adorned the room we were in,
called the Long Parlour.  We were obliged
to assure "the divine Sarah" and her angry
comrades that the Lord Mayor meant no slight
to them or to their country in not having the
offending busts removed, and also had to
defend his lordship for not wearing his robes
and chain of office, and for being
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
unaccompanied by sword and mace bearers.  Incredible,
but true.
</p>

<p>
The finest piece of acting I ever saw from
"Sarah" was at the <i>répétition générale</i> in Paris
of Sardou's play <i>Fédora</i>.  She rose to great
heights, and held a brilliantly composed
audience under a spell and in her grasp.  Among
those present, I remember well, were Alexandre
Dumas, Alphonse Daudet, and Georges Ohnet;
Got and Coquelin; Blanche Pierson and Maria
Legault.
</p>

<p>
Edward Pigott, who was then the official
Reader of Plays, wrote to me:
</p>

<p>
"The English version of <i>Fédora</i> is an
admirable piece of literary workmanship.  It
reads almost like an English original.  The
part is all Sarah.  It is written exactly to her
measure&mdash;that electric play of feature and
gesture, that nervous intensity, that range
of power and variety of accent, and sudden
changefulness of mood, which belong to the
feline instinct or temperament."
</p>

<p>
Later on, when I saw that great actress&mdash;so
soon to be a legend, a tradition&mdash;Eleanora
Duse, play in <i>Fédora</i> I learnt that Sardou
and Sarah had left some things unthought
of.
</p>

<p>
Here is a little letter from the brilliant
Frenchwoman:
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"BIEN CHÈRE, MADAME,
</p>

<p>
"Je vous remercie mille fois pour vos si
belles roses et l'aimable lettre de Monsieur
Bancroft.  Je suis très heureuse que vous ayez
pris plaiser à m'entendre, et très touchée que
deux artistes de votre valeur m'accordent du
talent.
</p>

<p>
"Veuillez me croire reconnaissante, et agréez,
Madame, je vous prie, mes meilleurs sentiments.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"SARAH BERNHARDT."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Years afterwards, on the fiftieth anniversary
of the great actress's first appearance
on the stage, my wife was chosen to
present a testimonial which had been prepared
in her honour, in the presence of a remarkable
gathering in which Monsieur Paul
Cambon, the honoured French Ambassador
to our Court for so many years, took a
prominent part.
</p>

<p>
These were some of her words:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Dear Madame Bernhardt, or, as you have
so closely fastened yourself to our hearts 'with
hoops of steel,' I hope you will allow me to say,
dear Sarah.  My words will be brief, but they
come from my heart&mdash;the heart of a comrade
and friend.  Since my retirement no greater
pleasure has befallen me than I feel at this
moment, and when I was invited to perform
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
this delightful ceremony I was proud to be
remembered and to be thought worthy to
have the honour of presenting this tribute to
your genius; an endorsement, as it were, of
the force and value of the <i>Entente Cordiale</i>
which so happily unites our two great
countries.  Your fame belongs to all the
world&mdash;the homage of every land is yours.
Your name will live with those of Siddons,
Rachel and Ristori.  You have shed lustre
and glory on the beautiful art you have so
long and nobly served and in which you reign
supreme."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The great woman took the opportunity to
repeat her opinion given to a mutual friend,
Hamilton Aidé, years before, of my wife's
acting as Peg Woffington.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Aimée Desclée
</span>
</p>

<p>
But great as she was, unequalled in technique,
wonderful in the range of her art, perfect in
her command of every tone in her beautiful
language, Sarah Bernhardt was never to my
mind quite free from the blemish&mdash;it may be
thought heresy to say so&mdash;of being something
of a show-woman.  The drum was too big
in her orchestra, while I always considered
her to be surpassed in the reality of emotion
and passion by one other woman I have seen
upon the stage&mdash;Aimée Desclée.  No other
serious actress, to my mind, took more absolute
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
possession of her audience.  I doubt if even
Rachel could have eclipsed her.  Her acting
in <i>Froufrou</i>, her original part, was supreme.
The quarrel with her sister I can best describe
as a whirlwind of dramatic art in its highest
form, as was the pathos with which&mdash;when
she had wrecked her life and gone away with
her lover&mdash;she moaned: "<i>Une heure de colère,
et voilà ou j'en suis.</i>"  Only those who are
now quite old can have seen Desclée.  Her
fame was achieved in a few brief years, as she
died in the flower of youth, being little more
than thirty, if my memory serves me, in 1873.
When Sarah then was asked her opinion of
Desclée's acting she answered, "Truth!"  She
made no claim to beauty, but possessed more
"magnetism"&mdash;I know no better word&mdash;unclouded
by exaggeration than any of her rivals.
Had Desclée been spared to act for twenty
years her name would have lived among the
immortals.
</p>

<p>
Alexandre Dumas thus wrote of her:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Nothing remains of what was once so dear.
Let us regret this great artist, but pity not her
death.  She has won the rest for which she
prayed.  Her best reward is death.  Of the
details of her actual life I have told you
nothing.  Where was she born?  How was
she brought up?  Where did she first appear?
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
What became of her?  What matters it at all?
A woman like her has no biography.  She
touched our souls: and she is dead.  There is
her history."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Réjane
</span>
</p>

<p>
Another Frenchwoman whose name and
fame give her an honoured place among the
great ones, was Réjane.  Our acquaintance
began with a visit she paid us behind the
scenes at the Haymarket when she was quite
young.  My wife at the time was acting the
part first played by Réjane in a play by Sardou,
called <i>Odette</i>.
</p>

<p>
She was never a guest at our table at home,
but only when we met in France.  Her art
was the embodiment of abiding charm in
<i>Ma Cousine</i>, in <i>La Vierge Folle</i>, in <i>Madame
Sans-Gêne</i>, and many another play.  Paris
loved her and she loved Paris.  How they
must miss each other!
</p>

<p>
She was proud of her Montmartre origin,
where she passed a poor and hard-working
youth, painting fans and teaching.  She told
the company assembled to celebrate her
nomination to the <i>Légion d'Honneur</i>, that it
was at Montmartre she learnt her art and
at Montmartre, in contact with lovers of the
theatre, that she perfected it.
</p>

<p>
I remember the days in London when her
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
carriage was drawn by a pair of Spanish mules
and people would struggle for a glimpse of her
fascinating, though not beautiful, face.  The
last time I saw Réjane was at the Queen's
Hall, during the War, when she recited Émile
Cammaerts's poem, <i>Carillon</i>, to the music
written for it by the composer, Edward Elgar,
who conducted it himself.  All concerned
seemed to be inspired and gave you out of
themselves some minutes of ecstasy; just as
Karsavina and Nijinsky did in <i>The Spectre of
The Rose</i> at Covent Garden, before the War.
These are things which are yours while memory
lasts.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Modjeska
</span>
</p>

<p>
A dear friend and guest was the brilliant
Helena Modjeska.  Like the distinguished
actor, Fechter, she never quite mastered the
difficulties of the English tongue, but again,
as in the Frenchman, her foreign accent
became a fascination.  She ran the great Sarah
very close in <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i>.  Her
performance was the more spiritual: she
seemed to have sacrificed purity only through
passion and was ever fighting for Divine
forgiveness.  You almost had doubts if she could
have so sinned, but none as to her salvation.
My wife could give a most dramatic imitation
of their different treatments of the tragic end,
when with difficulty the feeble, outstretched
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
hands reached a table-mirror and they looked
upon their dying faces.  It was hard to decide
if the heart-rending, pitiful wail with which
the one murmured, "How changed I am!"
was surpassed by the terrifying awe which
slowly spread over the emaciated face of the
other.  Both were supreme moments in their
beautiful art.
</p>

<p>
I recall an incident at a dinner given by
Madame Modjeska and her husband, when
the subject of an unhappy break-up of what
seemed a happy marriage through an unfortunate
lapse on the husband's part became the
topic.  The lady by my side said passionately:
"That is an indiscretion, an outrage, a sin,
call it what you will, I could never
forgive&mdash;whoever the woman might be."  She paused
for a moment and added: "With one
exception&mdash;Ellen Terry.  Any man <i>ought</i> to be
forgiven."
</p>

<p>
Let me say a word about an Irish girl born
at Limerick but taken to America in her
childhood; the delightful, alluring Ada Rehan.
She and Irving were our guests, both for the
last time, together, I remember, and when
they sat side by side.  No words of mine could
compete with those I copy, written by one
who had followed Ada Rehan's art in every
phase:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
</p>

<p>
"The secret of her allurement was elusive.
Among its elements were absolute sincerity,
the manifest capability of imparting great
happiness, triumphant personal beauty, touched
and softened by a wistful and sympathetic
sadness, and that controlling and compelling
instinct, essentially feminine, which endows with
vital import every experience of love, and
creates a perfect illusion in scenes of fancied
bliss or woe."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Gifted women
</span>
</p>

<p>
It has been a pleasant task to pay my tribute
to brilliant artists of foreign birth; I do not
wish to write of gifted women now before the
public, but let me render homage to comrades
of the stage in days gone by who were born in
these isles, and who reigned in their kingdom
with a splendour equal to the great of any
land.  That mistress of her beautiful art,
Madge Kendal; the incomparable Ellen Terry;
the glorious and unique Mrs. John Wood;
and Marie Bancroft&mdash;the salt of the art they
adorned, who, in their bright springtime and
their affluent summer, filled the scene: all
as distinct from one another as Raphael from
Rubens, as Watts from Whistler, yet each
stamping the mark of her personality on
every part she played, and of whom it might
be said the deaf could hear them in their
eloquent faces: the blind could see them
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
in their vibrant voices.  Deep is the debt
which never can be paid for the cares they
lightened, for the sorrows they soothed; they
dragged creatures from the books wherein
they were born, making them live, their
hearts beating, their pulses throbbing, and
enshrined their joyousness in many grateful
memories.
</p>

<p>
The mantle of the great must be of their
own weaving; on other shoulders it is bound
to be a misfit.
</p>

<p>
It is pleasant to have one's views confirmed;
the more so in the judgment of a distinguished
American man of letters whose knowledge of
people connected with the stage was remarkable.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Our age indeed has no Colley Cibber to
describe their loveliness and celebrate their
achievements; but surely if he were living at
this hour, that courtly, characteristic, and
sensuous writer&mdash;who saw so clearly and could
portray so well the peculiarities of the feminine
nature&mdash;would not deem the period of Marie
Bancroft and Ellen Terry, of Clara Morris and
Ada Rehan, of Sarah Bernhardt and Jane
Hading, unworthy of his pen.  As often as
fancy ranges over those bright names and
others that are kindred with them&mdash;a glistering
sisterhood of charms and talents&mdash;the regret
must arise that no literary artist with just the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
gallant spirit, the chivalry, the fine insight
and the pictorial touch of old Cibber is extant
to perpetuate their glory."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Ouida
</span>
</p>

<p>
I turn to another calling, and can say
something of two distinguished women whose fame
was earned as writers of fiction&mdash;Ouida (Louise
de la Ramée) and Miss Braddon (Mrs. Maxwell).
They were much of an age, but their careers
had no other resemblance; except in their
enormous vogue and hold upon the public of
their day.
</p>

<p>
The name "Ouida" was a nursery corruption
of Louisa.  She had an English mother
and a French father, but lived chiefly in
Italy.
</p>

<p>
My wife and I first met her at the Langham
Hotel, where she stayed when in London&mdash;as
odd to look upon as she was pleasant to talk
with.  She had strange large eyes of a sort of
dark blue and, in her white satin gown and
sandalled shoes, was strangely reminiscent of
mid-Victorian days.  She always wore white
frocks in the summer time and, as I was told,
black velvet in the winter months.
</p>

<p>
We hoped Ouida might, as she earnestly
wished, write a play for us, but she got no
further than a title.  Of her novels, if I
remember rightly, quite a fairly good play was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
concocted from <i>Moths</i>.  She had a great
appreciation of my wife, both on and off the
stage, and we valued her friendship.  There
are few readers nowadays, I suppose, of <i>Under
Two Flags</i>, <i>Puck</i>, or <i>Two Little Wooden Shoes</i>,
which engrossed the public of her time.  She
was proud of the fact that Bulwer Lytton
read every book she wrote.
</p>

<p>
As an instance of her "style," here is a
description of a young Italian peasant girl:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"The marigolds and the sunflowers had
given her their ripe rich gold to tint her hair;
the lupins had lent their azure for her eyes;
the moss-rose buds had made her pretty mouth;
the arum lilies had uncurled their softness
for her skin; and the lime blossoms had given
her their frank, fresh, innocent fragrance."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Ouida would have had no vogue in these
times.  She violently opposed female suffrage
and expressed her view that "millions of
ordinary women have as little of the sage in
them as of the angel."
</p>

<p>
As for the new woman, she wrote of her as
"violating every law alike of common sense
and of artistic fitness, and yet comes forward
as a fit and proper person to make laws for
others."  She was strong in her views that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
the private lives of all artists are not fit objects
of curiosity, and was firm in declining, in
unedited language, to be interviewed.  Ouida
was undoubtedly an eccentric, with a golden
heart, and a passion for dogs.  She died in
her beloved Italy, alas! in abject poverty,
mainly due, I fear, to her unpractical nature
and her uncurbed generosities.  No one is
left to tell us what became of all the lovely
things by which she was surrounded in her
prosperous days at the Florentine Villa
Farinola.  I think she rests in peace.
</p>

<p>
Not long before the end my wife received
this letter from her:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"DEAR THALIA,
</p>

<p>
"I have been and am still very ill.
For two days I was near death.  I should
grieve to leave my dear dogs.  Their lives are
too short in comparison with their devotion.
I got your long letter after some delay and fear
many letters are lost between Italy and
England.  I have seen a bag filled with the
contents of pillar-boxes reposing in sweet
solitude on the pavement of a deserted street
in Florence!
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad that you and your dear
husband are well and happy....  I wish I
could come and see you all and the dear
old country where its sons and daughters
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
are never content except when they are out
of it.
</p>

<p>
"Love to you and Sir Squire.  Believe me,
always your and his admirer and friend.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"OUIDA."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Miss Braddon
</span>
</p>

<p>
I was a young actor in the country, full
sixty years ago, when a new novel appeared
which made the writer of it&mdash;a girl in her
twenties&mdash;famous throughout the land.  The
book was <i>Lady Audley's Secret</i>.  The girl was
Miss Braddon.  The fame of the new novel
spread like wildfire and the rush for its three
volumes&mdash;most novels were so published in
those days&mdash;was extraordinary.
</p>

<p>
From one of the old Strand Theatre
burlesques I recall words like these: "Always
a lady's secret I respect, save <i>Lady Audley's
Secret</i> which that deep Mudie lets out and
won't let people keep."
</p>

<p>
Dickens and Thackeray were still alive and
at work, as were George Eliot, Bulwer Lytton
and Wilkie Collins.
</p>

<p>
Miss Braddon's own share reached more
than seventy novels in more than fifty years
of work.  We knew her for many of those
years, and loved her company, here in London,
as in Switzerland and Italy.
</p>

<p>
In a long railway journey we took together
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
from Lugano to Boulogne some anxiety arose
as we neared the sea about what the "crossing"
would be like.  I remember Mrs. Maxwell's
amusement at my wife's saying: "I don't feel
comfortable about it; the small boats and
fishing-smacks in harbour are too polite to
each other, with their little bows and curtseys.
I fear we shall find things more quarrelsome
when we have crossed the bar."
</p>

<p>
The famous novelist was an open-air woman,
at home in a saddle, loved to follow the hounds,
and was devoted to her dogs, her cats and her
birds.  She adored Dickens, had great
admiration for Balzac, and placed George Eliot on a
lofty pedestal.  The way she did her work
was the oddest thing in the world.  She
huddled herself up in a little low chair, made a
desk of her knees, and wrote for hours in that
position.
</p>

<p>
Happily, she bountifully bequeathed her
power over the pen to her son "Willie," who
has the affection of his troops of friends.
</p>

<p>
I will close this chapter with a reference,
full of kind thoughts and remembrances, to
one of the most remarkable, as she was one
of the most delightful, women my wife and I
ever had the privilege to know&mdash;Lady Dorothy
Nevill.  She was a great little lady&mdash;happy,
blithesome, clever, and so gay.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
</p>

<p>
At her Sunday luncheon parties in Charles
Street, one met everybody worth knowing
and heard pretty well everything worth listening
to.  There assembled folk of all opinions
and of every class and calling&mdash;honey gathered
from many a hive.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A great little lady
</span>
</p>

<p>
Few people could have had&mdash;and kept&mdash;three
such different friends as Cobden, Disraeli
and Chamberlain; but the little lady knew
how to deal with contradictions.  Her sense
of humour was as keen as a razor.
</p>

<p>
Happily for us, Lady Dorothy loved a
play and rejoiced in visits to our theatre.
She had a great affection for my wife.  Often
and often, generally in the early winter
evenings, she would dismiss her carriage at
our door, walk upstairs to the second floor,
and sit for hours with her.  When she left
she declined all help or offer to be seen
safely home, preferring to walk there in the
dark, facing two crossings on her way, and
this when she was more than eighty years
of age.
</p>

<p>
Her reminiscences, edited by her son, Ralph
Nevill, are delightful reading, while the
characteristic portrait painted of her in early life
by Watts&mdash;so happily reproduced&mdash;will tell
you what she looked like.  It helps you to
feel that she uttered no ill of anyone.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
</p>

<p>
Lady Dorothy once said to me: "One of
the greatest treats I can now be given is to be
taken by a strong young man to Piccadilly,
there to be hoisted on to the top of a 'bus, and
driven through the City to Whitechapel, with
time to look in at the London Hospital on my
way back."
</p>

<p>
I repeat&mdash;a great little lady.

THE CHURCH
</h3>

<p class="intro">
"There is, I know not how, in the minds of men, a certain
presage, as it were, of a future existence; and this takes the
deepest root, and is most discoverable in the greatest geniuses
and most exalted souls."&mdash;CICERO.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
We have not been honoured with the friendship
of distinguished members of the Church
so intimately as to leave many empty chairs
once filled by them, but I can write something
in affectionate remembrance of a few.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
J. M. Bellew
</span>
</p>

<p>
The first prominent clergyman whom we
knew was that strange creature Bellew, first
as the Reverend J. M. Bellew, when he preached
at a church in Bloomsbury and drew large
congregations, having previously enjoyed great
popularity at St. Mark's, Hamilton Terrace.
He was gifted with an exceptionally fine voice
and a striking appearance.  I never heard the
death chapter from the Corinthians better
read than by him&mdash;it was dramatic without
being theatrical.  There was, however, a
pitfall into which he used to stumble when he
attacked the Commandments&mdash;in the Fifth
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
he thundered out the first three words "Honour
thy father," then dropped his voice to its
softest tones, quietly murmuring, "and thy
mother."
</p>

<p>
Later on, he became both friend and
neighbour.
</p>

<p>
I will repeat a story he told of another
neighbour, a canon of the Church, who wore
the most palpable of wigs, which took every
shade of colour in the sunlight, but was blindly
convinced in his own mind that no one shared
his secret.  Bellew met this friend one morning
as he was leaving his house, and suggested
their proceeding together.  "Delighted," said
the owner of the many-coloured "jasey"; "I
am going to Bond Street <i>to get my hair cut</i>."  The
pretender went so far as to have various
wigs of different lengths to aid the evident
deception.
</p>

<p>
In middle life Bellew appeared as a public
reader and reciter here and in America, having
left the Church of England, and become a
devout Roman Catholic, in which faith he
died.
</p>

<p>
Henry White, the Chaplain of the Chapel
Royal, Savoy, as it then was, was many a time
a welcome Sunday guest, almost invariably
punctual, though always begging to be forgiven
should he not be.  His letters, carefully
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
sealed with the Savoy arms, were full of
quotations, such as, "I cannot tell you how
much I value the friendship you have allowed
me to enjoy so long: 'my love's more richer
than my tongue,'" while his interesting
sermons were often described as "elegant
extracts."  His reading of the Litany was
peculiarly impressive.  The Baroness Burdett-Coutts
was a frequent member of his restricted
congregation.  I left an evening party in his
company long years ago, when we walked
together towards our different homes.  On
the way I put a straight question to him
on a sacred subject.  His answer was frank
enough: "If it is in my power to be of use
to you, or indeed to any man, it can only be
from my pulpit."  He tried his utmost to
persuade me to read the Lessons in the Chapel
Royal.  I firmly declined, adding that if I
consented I should ask to be allowed to select
them.  "Even that," he said, "might be
arranged."
</p>

<p>
An old, and to us, dearly-loved friend who
also enjoyed his Sunday visits, was the
Sub-Dean of the Chapels Royal, Canon Edgar
Sheppard.  Our hospitality was returned by
him and Mrs. Sheppard at their quaint old
home adjoining Marlborough House Chapel:
and I also knew the Canon in his other home,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
so picturesque, in the precincts of Windsor
Castle.  One of his last public services was
held for me when my sorrow came.  His friendship
had so long been valued by my wife; the
kindness shown to me then, as well as by his
son, the present vicar of St. Martin-in-the-Fields,
dwells sacredly in my memory, and
will be referred to in the final chapter of this
book.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Archdeacon Wilberforce
</span>
</p>

<p>
Archdeacon Wilberforce&mdash;who belonged to
the 1841 "Vintage"&mdash;was also our friend.
He drew large congregations to the church of
St. John the Evangelist, Westminster&mdash;that
odd-looking building which looks rather like
an elephant sprawling on his back with his
short legs in the air.  I recall an afternoon
when we were the guests of Mrs. Wilberforce
and himself in Dean's Yard; he took us aside
and said they were asking some of their
friends to linger when the party broke up,
as they had a treat to follow.  We gladly did
so, and were well repaid, being conducted to
the Abbey by the Archdeacon, and seated in
the choir.  Presently Sir Frederick
Bridge&mdash;("Westminster Bridge ")&mdash;another old friend
who has left an empty chair&mdash;broke the
silence&mdash;the tones of the organ swelled
out&mdash;when, from by his side in the loft and out
of sight, the wonderful voice of Clara Butt
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
sang "Abide with Me."  There are moments
in life, and that was one, the remembrance
of which can never fade; this we felt, as
afterwards we went from the Abbey in the
falling light.
</p>

<p>
I recall an occasion when both Bishop
Ellicott and Archdeacon Wilberforce were
staying at Birchington.  The Bishop was gravely
ill.  We had known him in the Engadine and
at the Bel Alp, and had also been to those
musical parties in Great Cumberland Place,
to which Mrs. Ellicott and all her family were
so passionately and unceasingly devoted that
they seemed to fill their lives.  The Bishop
was always expected to be a listener.  My
wife drove to the bungalow where the
Bishop was, to ask after him, and, to her
delight, was told he would like to see her.
She found the Archdeacon by his side, and as
she approached his chair the Bishop was
thanking him for "kind and comforting
words," adding: "I hope, my dear friend,
when it shall please God to take me, He will
graciously grant me a little niche&mdash;and <i>not
too near the music!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The Archdeacon's love of animals is well
known.  He adored his dogs, and at a
garden-party showed us the graves of little
lost friends by the Cloisters, dwelling in a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
most interesting way on his belief in their
after-life.  In support of this, I recall an
incident told by my old comrade, John Hare,
when he had a seaside home at Overstrand.
The Archdeacon visited him one day: and
Hare, who was never without a dog, put a
question to him.
</p>

<p>
"Do you really believe, Archdeacon," he
asked, "in a hereafter for our dogs?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I do."
</p>

<p>
"But do you mean that I shall meet my
dog again?"
</p>

<p>
"Undoubtedly&mdash;if you are good enough!"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Father Bernard Vaughan
</span>
</p>

<p>
A friend whom it was always a pleasure to
welcome or to meet was Father Bernard
Vaughan.  We became acquainted many years
ago at Manchester, where my wife and I were
acting.  He was then the rector of a church
there, and would come and see us at our hotel,
and tell us Lancashire stories.  From time
to time he visited us in London, and later on
at our seaside home.
</p>

<p>
He never spoke a word to me on religious
subjects, knowing, I suppose, that I did not
chance to belong to the beautiful faith which
he and his many brothers and sisters so
devoutly served as priests and nuns, beginning
with the eminent Cardinal.  Father Bernard
Vaughan attracted crowded congregations,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
drawn from all degrees of creed, to Farm
Street, there to listen to his outspoken sermons
on the Sins of Society.  They were both romantic
and emotional, with sentences to the effect
that unless England fed the fires of religion
with the fuel of faith she might wake one day
to the sound of a passing bell tolling her soul's
death.
</p>

<p>
The circumstances in which I first saw
Dr. Boyd-Carpenter, then the Bishop of Ripon,
were comical, although the scene of them was
a place of worship.  I have a predilection for
a good sermon, and at one period made a
practice of hearing the best English preachers of
the day, no matter what their particular aspect
of the Faith might be.  On a Saturday I read
in <i>The Times</i> that the Bishop of Ripon was
to preach at the Chapel Royal, Whitehall;
so I determined to go and listen.
</p>

<p>
The Chapel Royal, Whitehall, exists no
more, but at that time it occupied the first
floor of the old banqueting hall (from one of
the windows of which King Charles I stepped
forth to his execution), since given over to the
Royal United Services Institution.  The hall
was not, from the clergy's point of view, well
adapted to its sacred purpose, for there was
no vestry, or, at any rate, no separate entrance
for the officiating minister, who could only
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
enter the chapel by the staircase in the same
way as the general public.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The verger's mistake
</span>
</p>

<p>
Presenting myself on a wintry morning,
some time before the appointed hour, after
fighting my way up the crowded staircase,
I found the chapel already full, when the
verger, catching sight of and recognising me,
whispered that if I waited a moment he would
find a seat for me among the front rows.  Just
then I felt someone trying to push past me,
and looking down saw a small and energetic
figure, the head swathed in a large white
muffler, eagerly struggling to make towards
the altar.  The verger, prompt but polite,
attempted to stop the vigorous little man.
"You really can't, sir; there isn't another
empty place."
</p>

<p>
What was the good man's surprise and confusion
to receive the answer, in a telling stage
whisper: "But I've come to preach!"
</p>

<p>
The intruder was no other than the Bishop,
then in the prime of life.  When at last he
reached the pulpit, he preached so fine a
sermon that though my watch told me it
lasted only five minutes short of an hour, it
seemed to occupy less than the half of one.
</p>

<p>
Another trenchant and dramatic sermon I
recall was preached by Boyd-Carpenter in
the Abbey soon after the death of Tennyson,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
when the Bishop shattered an idea which had
got abroad that the great poet had no faith
in an after-life.  Who, I wonder, could have
attributed such thoughts to the man who
wrote: "I hope to meet my Pilot face to face
when I have crossed the bar"?  The only
time I saw the Victorian Poet Laureate, a
picturesque figure, was on board a Channel
steamer.  He passed the time between Calais
and Dover on the bridge, talking with the
captain and smoking a short clay pipe.
</p>

<p>
Acquaintance with the Bishop soon followed
the episode at the Chapel Royal, and, I rejoice
to add, warm friendship with my wife and
myself both in London and at our seaside
home, which lasted until his death.
</p>

<p>
There is a story told of the Bishop&mdash;which
may or may not be true&mdash;of his being rudely
interrupted at a public meeting by the query
if he believed Jonah was really swallowed by
the whale.  The Bishop said that if he got to
heaven he would try to find out.  The man
in the crowd answered loudly: "But suppose
he is not there?"  The Bishop at once replied:
"Then you'll have to ask him."  For my own
part, I have always thought that Jonah's
condition was like that of a vulgar
tourist&mdash;he travelled much and saw little.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Speaking and reading
</span>
</p>

<p>
I remember well a happy week-end passed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
with the Bishop at his palace, and a delightful
drive in the snow to Fountains Abbey.  It was
then that he persuaded me to undertake the
difficult task of saying something at a
forthcoming Church Congress on "The Art of
Speaking and Reading," and I devoted time
and thought to so important a subject.
</p>

<p>
I began by saying that it was customary for
a clergyman to preface his sermon by a text
from the Bible, but that I, as an actor, would
begin my address with a quotation from
Shakespeare to be found in the comedy of <i>Much
Ado About Nothing</i>: "Happy are they that
hear their detractions and can put them to
mending."
</p>

<p>
This text, if I may so call it, led to some
remarks on the affinity between the words of
Shakespeare and the pages of Holy Writ.  The
same inspired truths so abound throughout
them both as to prove that the poet was a
student of the Scriptures.  There could be
no firmer bond between Church and Stage; it
must, for all time, be the strongest link, for
both books are eternal.
</p>

<p>
I called to mind the care and cost lavished
upon choral services in our cathedrals, the
pains taken to acquire the skill melodiously to
chant the Litany: why were not the same
labour, the like devotion bestowed upon the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
teaching of young clergymen to speak audibly
and to control a congregation?  One could not
but be amazed at glaring instances of false
emphasis in the dull recital of the Order for
Morning Prayer: surely such a monument of
learning and piety should be spared such
treatment.
</p>

<p>
I dared to add that I had heard the Bible
read&mdash;now and then very beautifully, often
very vilely.  That I had listened to such
extracts as tell of the death of Absalom, of the
death of Jezebel, of Daniel in the Den, of the
Prodigal's Return, read as though the moving
stories were little more dramatic than so many
stale problems in Euclid; and had heard
St. Paul's funeral chapter so droned as to make the
hallowed bones of the Apostle who bequeathed
it to humanity turn in their resting-place.  On
the other hand, I had heard the same words
read so truthfully by men who are living
and men who are dead, as to be a lasting
memory.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The actor and the bishop
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was natural on my part to draw attention
to the resemblance which exists between the
great preacher and the famous player, not only
for the mighty sermons he can preach, but
because, when his work is done, when he has
for ever left the pulpit or the stage, the
"divine spark" is extinguished; his voice,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
his fascination, his originality, are soon but
memories; while his renown too often rests
upon the imperfect records of tradition.  The
personality of John Knox must remain a
mystery; the tragic tones of Sarah Siddons
can be heard no more.  What would the
young parson not give to hear Martin Luther
preach?  What would I not give to see
David Garrick act?  "Into the night go one
and all."
</p>

<p>
I reminded my listeners of the answer David
Garrick gave to the bishop who asked him
this question: "Can you tell me, sir, why it
is that you players, who deal with romance,
can yet profoundly move an audience, while
we preachers, who deal with reality, fail
to do so?"  "Yes, my lord, I can.  It is
because we players act fiction as if it
were the truth; while you preachers too
often speak of truth as though it were but
fiction."
</p>

<p>
Thackeray wrote: "There is an examiner
of plays, and there ought to be an examiner
of sermons."  I would go further, and urge
that every curate should pass an examination
in the art of preaching before he is allowed to
mount a pulpit.  A bad preacher will empty
a church more easily than a good preacher will
fill one.  It was well said, also, by an eminent
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
minister in the Nonconformist Church, the late
Dr. Parker:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"To-day the man who would preach with
true and lasting effect must be sincere,
intelligent, and sympathetic&mdash;in a word, he must
be a man, a teacher, a friend.  Preaching is
the most impertinent of all impertinences if
there is not behind it and round about it a
sense of authority other and better than
human."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The best advice I can remember was once
given by my wife, in a single sentence, to a
public speaker who consulted her on the
subject; she said simply: "Don't be afraid
of opening your mouth, and don't forget that
the roof of it is Nature's sounding-board."
</p>

<p>
Bishop Boyd-Carpenter, as some may still
recollect, was honoured with the personal
friendship of the late Empress Frederick of
Germany.  In connection with that unhappy
lady, the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria,
and our Princess Royal, he told me an interesting
story, the point of which was to be proved
tragically true in later years.
</p>

<p>
The Bishop was summoned to Germany to
give the Empress the consolations of religion
in a grave illness.  The Prince of Wales, who
had hastened to the bedside of his favourite
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
sister, in the kindness of his peace-loving heart
was attempting to smooth over the notorious
differences between the suffering lady and her
son, the ex-Kaiser, who, as is well-known, had
treated her with unfilial harshness.  But the
Empress knew Wilhelm too well to hope for
reconciliation.  She laid her hand on her
brother's arm, saying sadly and earnestly:
"Bertie, your country has no greater enemy
than my son."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A Mohammedan legend
</span>
</p>

<p>
Among my papers I find a letter from
Boyd-Carpenter, redeeming a promise which he had
made over the dinner-table to look up for me
a Mohammedan legend upon which he had
preached a remarkable sermon:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"When God made the earth it shook to and
fro till He put the mountains on it to keep it
firm.
</p>

<p>
"Then the angels asked: 'O God, is there

The wrong train
</span>
</p>

<p>
I may here relate an unaccountable blunder
I committed when on my way to do a little
service for the Bishop at Bradford.  At that
time there were two express trains to the North,
one from Euston, the other from King's Cross;
both started at 1.30.  Full of thought, I drove
to Euston instead of to King's Cross.  When
I asked for a ticket there was some delay; at
last it was given to me with the name of my
destination written upon it in ink.  I thought
it strange that tickets for so important a place
should be out of print, but took my seat in
the train; and it was only when well beyond
Rugby that I realised what I had done.
Eventually, after hurried, anxious talk with the
authorities at Stafford, I got out at Stockport.
There, in great excitement, I ordered a special
train and telegraphed home to allay anxiety.
Some difficulties about the special were
overcome by earnest appeals to disregard cost, as I
was prepared to pay anything demanded of
me, for never in my life had I failed to keep an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
appointment with the public, and should have
been doubly distressed at breaking an
engagement in which I was doing the work without
any question of a fee.  Eventually I reached
Bradford five minutes before the time fixed
for the entertainment.  To add to my troubles,
the confusion had driven out of my head the
name of the hall where I was to appear.
Fortunately, one of the flymen on the station
rank remembered it, and drove me quickly
to its doors as the audience was pouring in.
After inquiry at an hotel hard by&mdash;the same
hotel in which a few years later Irving stumbled
in the hall and then fell dead&mdash;I found the
Bishop.  He had telegraphed to London for
the cause of my absence, and, receiving no
explanation, had settled to fill my place by
giving his lecture on Dante; but on my
appearance he drove to the hall, asked for a short
delay, explained the reason, and then returned
to fetch me.  I dressed as if by magic, swallowed
some soup, and, appearing on the platform
only fifteen minutes late, was greeted with great
warmth.  I had never felt so pleased to face
my audience.
</p>

<p>
The Bishop of Ripon, like myself, was born
in the year 1841, and, like myself, was proud to
belong to that fine "vintage."
</p>

<p>
I am not likely to forget a dinner-party he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
gave at his home in the Abbey Cloisters in 1916
to a select band of "75's," or "soixante-quinzes,"
as he called us.
</p>

<p>
The company included the Bishop of Chichester
(Dr. Ridgeway), Field-Marshal Lord
Grenfell, Admiral Fisher, Lord Sanderson, Sir
Frank Lascelles, Sir Walter Parratt, Sir Donald
Mackenzie Wallace and myself.  The late Lord
Cromer was invited, but was prevented by
illness from being present.  Our host had not
only prepared for us a delightful evening, but
had composed some appropriate verses for the
occasion, of which each guest was presented
with a copy.  This is how they ran:
</p>

The good Bishop did not live to see the
return of Peace which followed the triumphant
victory of the <i>soixante-quinzes</i> and their
Allies.  In the month before the Armistice
was declared, he was laid in his grave.  But
he had not forgotten the happy gathering of
1916, as is proved by the following treasured
letter, which I received from his son, Major
Boyd-Carpenter:

More recently we lost another honoured
friend in that remarkable and distinguished
man, Dr. Wace, the Dean of Canterbury.
When we had a home by Folkestone he was
often our guest, while we have enjoyed the
hospitality of himself and Mrs. Wace at the
Deanery.  Their kindness at all times to my
wife is a happy remembrance.  The Dean
loved a good story: he told many and was an
appreciative listener.
</p>

<p>
I always read the powerful letters which he
wrote to <i>The Times</i>, and could not but admire
the strenuous blows he dealt with dauntless
courage on matters which were too profound
for the likes of me.  Shortly before his lamented
death I met the Dean at the Athenæum
and, during our talk, had more than one
proof of the undiminished power of his great
memory.

A disreputable trio
</span>
</p>

<p>
As an end to this chapter I quote the most
startling words I ever heard from a pulpit,
uttered by a prominent dignitary of the Church,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
in referring to the first chapter of Genesis, which
had been the lesson of the day: "Adam was a
cad; Eve, I am afraid, was no better than she
should be; and for my part, I have long since
regarded the silent serpent as the most
respectable of a disreputable trio."

  "For pity is the virtue of the law,<br>
  And none but tyrants use it cruelly."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There is a sort of affinity between the bar
and the stage: actors are attached to lawyers
because lawyers are attached to actors; at
least that has been my experience&mdash;my wife
and I were rich in their friendship from very
early days.
</p>

<p>
I have often thought there is a strong link
between our callings.  The feelings of the
distinguished counsel when he goes into court,
with all the anxious weight upon his mind,
with all his grave responsibility, cannot be
unlike the feelings of the great actor on a "first
night," when his fame may be in peril.
</p>

<p>
I was once, when a child, taken to the House
of Lords by my grandfather; he pointed out
to me the venerable Lord Brougham, who was
sitting in judgment with other Law Lords.  I
remember that he wore shepherd's plaid
trousers, also his nose, the famous nose which
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
was immortalised by Dicky Doyle on the mask
which is being dragged along the lower part
of the title page of <i>Punch</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Cockburn, L. C. J.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Lord Chief Justice Cockburn was the first
great man we knew; our meeting was at
dinner, when we were young, at the house of
Henry Fothergill Chorley, a worshipper of
Dickens and a prominent musical critic of
those days; two of the guests were "Mamie"
Dickens, the elder daughter of the great
novelist, and Arthur Sullivan, then quite young
and a protégé of our host.
</p>

<p>
I have never forgotten the feeling of awe
which came over me when the butler announced,
"The Lord Chief Justice of England."  I
always thought he looked less like a lawyer
than an admiral, or the skipper of his own
beloved yacht, the <i>Sybil</i>.  My wife had the
good fortune to be placed next to the Lord
Chief.  She had the gift of manners, and was at
home in any surroundings.  He took a great
fancy to her, and we enjoyed the charm of his
friendship for about ten years, until the end
of his career.  In those days I thought his was
the most attractive male voice I ever listened
to, whether on the Bench or in a room&mdash;even
during the lengthy summing-up of the Tichborne
trial it never grew monotonous&mdash;although I
admit that, nowadays, the voices of Johnston
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
Forbes-Robertson and Henry Ainley could run
it very close.
</p>

<p>
Let me add that the two most attractive
female voices I have listened to were owned by
women widely apart in rank and station: one
belonged to Queen Victoria, the other to my
wife, and both voices were preserved unto old
age.  It is pleasant to have this opinion
confirmed by no less a person than Ellen Terry,
who wrote of my wife "such a <i>very</i> pretty
voice&mdash;one of the most silvery voices I have
ever heard from any woman except the late
Queen Victoria, whose voice was like a silver
stream flowing over golden stones."
</p>

<p>
The Lord Chief was a perfect host, well
described as having the vivacity of youth
tempered by the wisdom of age.
</p>

<p>
He also adored music: it was almost certain
you would meet its professors at his house, and
I recall memories of Madame Schumann, Joachim
and Piatti.  During a short time when my
wife was not acting, her delight was great at
being taken by him to the <i>Monday Pops</i>.
Among his other accomplishments was an
intimate acquaintance with languages: his
French was as near perfection as a foreigner
could get to.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
"Justice is blind"
</span>
</p>

<p>
On one occasion when we had asked Sir
Alexander Cockburn to dine with us, my wife
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
took George Critchett, the eminent ophthalmic
surgeon and father of our lost friend, Sir
Anderson, to him, saying: "Let me present
Mr. Critchett to you, Lord Chief; as Justice is said
to be blind, you may find his services useful."  On
another, in reply to a similar invitation, he
wrote that he was just starting for Geneva to
preside at the Alabama Conference, and wished
that troublesome vessel had gone to the bottom
of the sea the day she was launched.  Soon
afterwards, at the close of our annual Swiss
holiday, we passed through Geneva just at
the time the Alabama claims were settled there,
and paid our respects to the Lord Chief at the
old Hôtel des Bergues, to the sound of guns
firing and the glory of flags flying.
</p>

<p>
This delightful friendship was broken suddenly.
It was in the year we opened our newly
rebuilt Haymarket Theatre, which he greatly
admired, that after presiding over an intricate
case in Westminster Hall, the Lord Chief left
the haunts of justice and the "law's delay"
for the last time.  He dismissed his smart little
brougham and walked home to Hertford Street.
During the night came a fatal attack of <i>angina
pectoris</i>.
</p>

<p>
When I was a struggling country actor in
Liverpool, so far back as 1864, I made the
acquaintance of a struggling barrister on the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
Northern Circuit.  His name was Charles
Russell, and he, too, became Lord Chief Justice of
England.  I enjoyed his friendship until his
death.  His personality was both dominating
and downright.  You could not be in a room
with him and not be conscious of his presence.
No man more firmly said what he meant and
meant what he said, while his Irish tongue was
ever ready with the apt bright answer, as, for
instance, when, asked the severest sentence for
bigamy, he answered: "Two mothers-in-law!"  He
was a relentless cross-examiner, and though
sometimes a sharp antagonist was always a
friend.  There was no littleness about him, and
he had no use for a fool.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Russell, L. C. J.
</span>
</p>

<p>
When I started my hospital "readings," I
made a point of avoiding any suggestion of
"creed," and arranged two recitals on behalf
of Jewish and Roman Catholic institutions:
at the former the Chief Rabbi presided, at the
latter Cardinal Vaughan promised to do so,
but was prevented by sudden illness: his
place was taken by the Lord Chief Justice.
Soon afterwards I was asked to serve a cause
which was pronouncedly Protestant.  In talking
over who was to be invited to preside, I
found the committee very desirous that Lord
Russell should be approached.  I pointed out
that he, being a fervent Roman Catholic,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
could hardly be expected to comply, adding
that he had only quite recently presided at a
"reading" of the same story which I had
given for the benefit of Catholics.  The
committee, however, said they could but be
refused, and made their request.  Lord Russell
replied that I had gone out of my way to help a
charity of his Faith, and that he would gladly
do the same for me.  The generous speech he
made on the occasion was a warm tribute to
the Reverend William Rogers&mdash;known widely
as "Hang Theology Rogers."  I cherish
the remembrance of many acts of kindness
shown to me and mine by Lord Russell of
Killowen, but not one of them touched me
more than that I have just related.
</p>

<p>
He was an ardent playgoer, with an intimate
knowledge of Shakespeare, and rarely missed
first nights, or when a play of one of his many
friends was produced.  He loved a game&mdash;of
cards or otherwise&mdash;and I have seen him at
Monte Carlo writhe because his exalted position
robbed him of the pleasure of a "flutter" at
<i>trente-et-quarante</i>.  He was a real sportsman
and a member of the Jockey Club.
</p>

<p>
I was greatly struck by a tribute the Lord
Chief paid to an old guest, a host and true
friend of mine for many years, the late Sir
George Lewis.  It was at the close of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
Parnell trial, when he spoke to this effect:
"The most remarkable attribute in George
Lewis is not his great knowledge of the law, not
his unrivalled skill in conducting difficult cases,
not his wonderful tact, not his genius for
compromise.  They are all beaten by his courage."
</p>

<p>
At a banquet given to Irving on his return
from one of his tours in the United States, I
was seated next to Lord Russell, who, half-way
through the dinner, suddenly said to me: "I
have to propose Irving's health.  What shall
I say?"  I replied that no one could answer
the question so well as himself.  However, the
Chief persisted, with that well-remembered,
imperious manner of his, "Come, come, my
friend, you must have done it often: tell me
what I am to say."  I recalled an occasion
when I had proposed Irving's health, and said
that I spoke of him as possessing "the strength
of a man, the sweetness of a woman, and the
simplicity of a child."  Lord Russell turned
to me with the question, "How about the
wisdom of a serpent?  I could not have left
that out."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Alverstone, L. C. J.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Lord Alverstone, so long known as "Dick"
Webster, who succeeded Russell, was Attorney-General,
Master of the Rolls, and Lord Chief
Justice, all in the same year.  It was as
Attorney-General that Webster dined with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
me, and I paid a pleasant visit in his company
to the Isle of Wight (which he represented in
the House of Commons) to do him a small
service.
</p>

<p>
I have always understood that he was a
great worker: one of the gang, like Francis
Jeune and Rufus Isaacs, who could light a
fire and brew tea at any ghastly hour a.m.
</p>

<p>
Soon after he became Lord Chief, Alverstone
presided at the Annual Dinner of the Actors'
Benevolent Fund.  He made an eloquent
appeal on its behalf and generously headed the
list of subscriptions.  This was not the only
instance of the real interest he took in the
drama, being of great service when the old
Covent Garden Theatre Fund came to an end.
</p>

<p>
He was no mean athlete, and fond of all
sports; also a capital singer&mdash;a conspicuous
figure for many years in the choir of the church
in the Kensington High Street.
</p>

<p>
I have had the privilege to know, but not
to act as their host, all the eminent lawyers
who have held the office of Lord Chief Justice
of England since the Cockburn days: Coleridge,
Reading, Trevethin and Hewart.
</p>

<p>
The late Lord Esher, Master of the Rolls,
my wife and I had the pleasure to know well
and to delight in his friendship and hospitality.
My acquaintance began when the Courts were
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
held in Westminster Hall, and I was foreman
of a jury before "Mr. Justice Brett," in an
interesting case, but troublesome to me, as
it kept me from important rehearsals.
</p>

<p>
In a New Year letter to my wife he addressed
her as:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"DEAR FRIEND,&mdash;You are a very perplexing
person to write to.  If I say 'Dear old friend'
it won't do in every sense: because, although
you are an old friend, you are in looks and
ways a young woman.  If I say 'Dear little
friend,' it is a term of endearment&mdash;but you
are a very great person.  However, I begin
by wishing you both a very happy year.  If
it is as prosperous as your goodness deserves
I can wish you in that respect no more.  I
cannot tell you how I chafed under not being
able to see you in <i>Money</i>; but in the mornings
I was in Court, and in the evenings did not
venture out!  Vile old age!!  Lady Esher
went to see you, and told me she had never
seen anything more charming than you.  With
that I stop.  My love to you both.  Believe
me always a very true admirer and very truly
yours."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Of all the judges I have known I think the
imposing presence of Lord Hannen on the
Bench was second to none.  His dignity appealed
to me enormously when, through the kindness
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
of the Bar, I attended some of the sittings of
the Parnell Commission.  I remember my
wife saying to him at our table, when he was
President of the Divorce Court, that he
seemed to her to pass too much of his life in
separating united couples.  His answer was
that he passed much more of it in wondering
why the couples had ever wished to be joined
together.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
James of Hereford
</span>
</p>

<p>
I never knew much of Lord James of Hereford,
but saw a good deal in early days of Mr. Henry
James, a successful self-made barrister
who had just taken silk, and was on the way
to the great position he reached.
</p>

<p>
He was one of a little coterie which included
Lord Anglesey, ("P."), Millais, Merewether,
Q.C., Hare, "Willie" Mathews, one or two
others, and myself, who played, with great
zest, an old-fashioned card game&mdash;four-handed cribbage.
</p>

<p>
James was made Attorney-General, refused
the Lord Chancellorship, and became a Peer.
</p>

<p>
I remember his once saying: "Fame has
no Present; Popularity no Future."
</p>

<p>
One of our early legal friends was Baron
Huddleston.  When we first met he was known
as "the buck of the Bar," and always pleaded
as Counsel in black kid gloves.  We owed to
him and "Lady 'Di'" many happy visits in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
delightful company to the Grange at Ascot.
He had his vanities, and gloried in being
written and spoken of as "The Last of the
Barons."
</p>

<p>
I was dining with Arnold Morley, at one
time Postmaster General, after Huddleston's
funeral, when I "put my foot in it" more
painfully than ever in my life.  The little
company comprised: John Morley, Herbert
Gardner, afterwards Lord Burghclere, Sir
Charles Dilke, George Lewis, Henry
Labouchere, and one other man whose name I
forget.  During dinner Lewis said: "Oh!
Bancroft, I saw by an evening paper that you
were among Huddleston's friends to-day, tell
us about his cremation; what is it really
like?"  Without thought I let myself go and replied
that when the coffin disappeared from view
Henry James (Lord James of Hereford) asked
Sir Henry Thompson, the pioneer and President
of the new movement, if we could see any
more.  Accompanied by Lord Falkland, we
entered the inner compartment, so I described
what we there saw, it being remembered that
cremation was then in its infancy, adding that
I revolted against the idea of consigning the
remains of a loved one to such a fate.  As I
spoke my eyes fell upon Sir Charles Dilke,
and I was conscious that his late wife had been
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
so treated.  It did not need the leer on
Labouchere's face to tell me so.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
St. Helier and Holker
</span>
</p>

<p>
Lord St. Helier, who became President of
the Divorce Court, was also a kind friend of
long standing.  My wife and I first met him
as Francis Jeune, when he was just foreshadowing
his successful career, at the house of Lady
St. Helier, Mrs. John Stanley then, and soon
afterwards we passed them in a carriage on
the St. Gothard Pass&mdash;before the days of its
wonderful railway&mdash;when they were on their
honeymoon.  He was a great authority on
ritualistic and ecclesiastical law generally and
always a tremendous worker.  He had charming
manners and was never ruffled&mdash;not even
when he committed a duchess to gaol.  We
enjoyed their hospitality in London and at
Arlington Manor.  I have only one little
objection to offer&mdash;I cannot help a feeling of
resentment against a judge, or, in fact, any
barrister, having a moustache and beard.  It
is not fair to the wig.
</p>

<p>
A dear friend of far-away days was Lord
Justice Holker ("Sleepy Jack").  I knew him
first in my old Liverpool apprenticeship when
he was leader of the Northern Circuit and its
legal giants.  I saw him once at the Assizes
there stop a case for some minutes after whispering
to his clerk, who hurriedly left the court,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
and returned with Holker's snuff-box, which
had been left in the robing-room.
</p>

<p>
Later on he had a place in Yorkshire where
he had happy shooting-parties for his friends,
but nothing would induce him to fire a gun
himself.
</p>

<p>
Another legal friend and welcome guest
was Lord Justice Mathew, who told us a pretty
story of his witty fellow-countryman, Father
Healy.
</p>

<p>
A young Englishwoman, who was his companion
at a dinner party, asked him, as there
was no mistletoe in Ireland, what the girls
and boys did at Christmas-time without it.
"Ah, if it's kissing you mean," the old priest
answered, "they do it <i>under the</i> rose!"
</p>

<p>
Mathew had a witty tongue of his own.
No doubt, it will be remembered by his legal
friends that at the time Herschell was Lord
Chancellor, Arthur Cohen, a distinguished
Q.C., quite looked to be appointed to a puisne
judgeship, which he did not get.  When
Mathew heard of Cohen's resentment, he
expressed surprise that his learned friend
expected anything else from Herschell but a
Passover.

<span class="sidenote">
Serjeant Ballantine
</span>
</p>

<p>
I made acquaintance in my early professional
days with Serjeant Ballantine, always
a pleasant and amusing companion, with a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
great love of the theatre.  Throughout his
life he was very Bohemian in his tastes and
habits.  I remember him first at Evans's,
a music-hall of those days, in Covent Garden&mdash;it
stood where prize-fights now take place at
the National Sporting Club&mdash;where there was
a noted choir of boys, and where "Paddy
Green," the manager, squeezed hot potatoes
from their jackets with his napkin for favoured
guests.
</p>

<p>
Ballantine devoted himself entirely to
criminal cases.  He was a great cross-examiner,
but he found his equal in Serjeant Parry, who
had masterly power over a jury.  Another of
his rivals was the distinguished advocate,
Henry Hawkins, afterwards Lord Brampton,
who was known to be as rich as Ballantine
was poor.  In a robing-room on one
occasion Ballantine asked Hawkins what he
was going to do with all his money, adding
that when he died he could not take it with
him, and that even if he could he feared it
would melt.
</p>

<p>
Ballantine defended the impostor Arthur
Orton, the "Claimant," in the first Tichborne
trial and professed belief in the genuineness
of that rascal.  Later he was retained for the
defence of the Gaekwar of Baroda in India.
He received for his services the largest fee then
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
known, but he lost the bulk of it at Monte
Carlo on his way home.
</p>

<p>
When I became acquainted with Frank
Lockwood he was a young actor at a seaside
theatre.  He did not, in the judgment of his
comrades, show much promise and wisely
abandoned the stage as a career.  I next
met him as a rising barrister at the house
of the Kendals, with whom he was on terms
of close friendship, as he soon became with
my wife and me.
</p>

<p>
Lockwood was a brilliant caricaturist.  His
company was always a delight.  I remember
an evening when he sat by me at dinner after
he had fought many a hard battle, and I asked
if he were offered a judgeship would he accept
it.  In a moment he answered, no; he loved
the fight too much.  Soon afterwards, however,
he had changed his mind, longed for relief
from the struggle and sighed for peace.  It
was not to be.  His health suddenly broke
down, his strength was failing, and he had to
give in.
</p>

<p>
Frank Lockwood was a popular leader at
the Bar, a genial Member in the House, a perfect
host, a welcome guest, a delightful companion,
a staunch friend.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Montagu Williams
</span>
</p>

<p>
The career of Montagu Williams was the
most varied of any man I have known.  Both
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
his father and his grandfather were barristers.
After he left Eton, Montagu was for a time a
schoolmaster; then fired, I suppose, by the
outbreak of the Crimean War, he entered the
Army.  After peace was declared he resigned
his commission and became a member of a
theatrical touring company with a well-known
amateur of those days, Captain Disney
Roebuck.  Next, on the advice, I believe, of his
godfather, Montagu Chambers, he resolved to
go to the Bar.  During his studies he wrote
for the Press, including Dickens's <i>Household
Words</i>.  He also wrote plays, chiefly in
collaboration with his old friend and school
companion at Eton, Frank Burnand.  The best of
them was <i>The Isle of St. Tropez</i>, a really good
drama, in which Alfred Wigan played.
</p>

<p>
From the time Montagu was called by the
Inner Temple there were few important criminal
cases in which he did not take a part&mdash;and
very quickly a prominent one.  His great
knowledge of every side of life and quick grasp
of things resulted in a large practice, and he
defended more scoundrels than any man of
his day.  Later on, he was grievously afflicted
by throat mischief, which ended in the saving
of his life at the cost of his voice, through a
serious operation; he could afterwards only
speak in a whisper.  He was, however,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
appointed a London police magistrate, in which
work he again distinguished himself, and soon
became known as "the poor man's beak."
</p>

<p>
It was during the theatrical episode in his
varied career that he came across, and married,
Louise, a daughter of two prominent and
respected early Victorian players, Mr. and
Mrs. Keeley, whom I remember seeing act so
long ago as 1851, the year of the Great
Exhibition, when Robert Keeley was the
partner of Charles Kean at the old Princess's
Theatre.
</p>

<p>
Louise Williams was gifted with a sweet
voice and sang with charm.  I still seem to
hear her exquisite rendering of Edgar Allan
Poe's words, which I can trust my memory
to recall:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And neither the angels in Heaven above,<br>
  Nor the demons down under the sea,<br>
  Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br>
  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I can recall no man who enjoyed more
universal popularity than Douglas Straight;
it began at Harrow and followed him throughout
his life.  He never allowed his interests
to become cramped: they embraced the law,
politics, journalism, sport, the drama and
society.  He began as a journalist, was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
Conservative M.P. for Shrewsbury, and had a
successful career at the Bar, which ended in a
judgeship of the High Court in India.
</p>

<p>
He had great social gifts, nowhere better
proved than by my friend Pett Ridge, who tells
a story of his popularity with the fair sex,
that twelve ladies agreed to give a dinner at a
fashionable restaurant, the novelty on the
occasion being that each of them was to be
responsible for one male guest.  The whole
dozen invited Douglas!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
"Willie" Mathews
</span>
</p>

<p>
I lost a close and affectionate friend in
Charles Mathews, the Public Prosecutor, whom
I first knew in the sixties, when he was a little
chap at Eton and wore a turn-down collar.
My next remembrance of him is as the "baby"
member of the Garrick Club, where, from the
date of his election, he was beloved.  In those
days "Willie" Mathews was "devil" to
Montagu Williams and working hard in his
company and that of Douglas Straight at the
criminal bar, the scene of many triumphs
in his successful career.  He was <i>persona grata</i>
wherever he went, and in widely different
circles, from Balmoral to Bohemia.
</p>

<p>
Charles Gill was another old friend.  We
saw more of him at his beloved Birchington
than in London.  He was known in his Kentish
home as "The Mayor"&mdash;so christened, I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
think, by his neighbour, that modern Colossus
who seems to be always striding between New
York and Leicester Square, the successful and
erratic Frederick Lonsdale.
</p>

<p>
Gill was closely associated in early days with
Straight and Mathews; later in his brilliant
career there was scarcely a sensational criminal
trial in which he did not play a leading part.
</p>

<p>
A very wise member of his profession only
lately said that were any friend of his in a
difficulty that called for unerring judgment
and delicacy of handling his best advice would
be: "Consult Charles Gill."

</p>

<p>
It is many years since, as my wife and I were
leaving the Savoy Theatre at the close of an
afternoon performance of a Gilbert and
Sullivan opera, we were shocked by a newsboy
shouting "Death of Lord Leighton."  We
made Frederic Leighton's acquaintance in the
green-room of our theatre.  Soon afterwards
we dined at his beautiful house in Kensington.
In its neighbourhood there was a nest of his
comrades in art, including Val Prinsep, Luke
Fildes and Marcus Stone.  We were friends
for years: he did me the honour to propose
me at the Athenæum, but did not live to
see me elected.  He was a remarkable and
gifted man&mdash;an Admirable Crichton&mdash;painter,
sculptor, linguist&mdash;as well as an eloquent, if a
somewhat florid, speaker, and an admirable
man of affairs, besides, as we actors say, having
a perfect appearance for his part.  Was it
not Thackeray who told him once that Millais
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
was the only man with a chance against him
for the Presidency of the Royal Academy?
</p>

<p>
His beautiful art was best illustrated in his
early days, I always thought, by <i>The Slinger</i>
and the sculptured figure of an athlete
struggling with a python.  I also remember
well his life-like portrait of the famous explorer,
Sir Richard Burton.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Millais
</span>
</p>

<p>
In many respects a total contrast to Leighton
was the successor to his great office, John
Everett Millais.  I was fortunate in his
acquaintance at the Garrick Club when I
was elected as a member fifty-six years ago.
Millais loved the club and cared but little
for any other.
</p>

<p>
Although looked upon as a Jerseyman, he
chanced to be born at Southampton, and I
remember being told by a man&mdash;who was for
many years prompter under our management&mdash;that
he had seen Millais, as a very small boy,
sprawling upon the stage of the Southampton
theatre and drawing with a piece of chalk
things that had form and shape.
</p>

<p>
I don't know when he first came into fame
and astounded the world by the wonderful
children of his brush and brain.  Beautiful
things teem through the memory.  I see the
little creature, on a church bench, listening to
<i>The First Sermon</i>; a work of infinite pathos
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
called <i>The Blind Girl</i>; Walter Raleigh on the
shingly shore, clutching his knees and absorbing
the yarns of an old sea-dog; the two nuns
digging a grave for a comrade in <i>The Vale
of Rest</i>; those well-known masterpieces, <i>The
Princes in the Tower</i>, <i>The Black Brunswicker</i>
and <i>The Order of Release</i>.  And then the gallery
of portraits&mdash;Tennyson, Newman, Gladstone,
Bright and the unfinished Disraeli.  Others
also crowd upon remembrance: those of my
comrades, Henry Irving and John Hare&mdash;not,
in my judgment, among his best examples,&mdash;of
Arthur Sullivan&mdash;one of the very best,&mdash;and
the great surgeon, Henry Thompson, which,
like the striking portrait of Mr. Wertheimer by
Sargent, as you look at it, seems that it might
speak.  I see also the beautiful portraits of
Mrs. Langtry and Mrs. Jopling Rowe, but,
alas! not one of my wife.  I offered Millais a
large sum to paint one of her for me, but he
declined, for two reasons; he said that he
could not bring himself to accept money from
a brother artist, and that he should fail, as the
face would change while his eyes turned even
for a moment to the palette.  One word to
recall his masterly landscapes, <i>Chill October</i>,
and, if I remember their attractive titles,
<i>The Fringe of the Moor</i> and <i>The Sound of Many
Waters</i>.  Never in any man's work was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
refinement more closely merged with art.  I see
a fine photograph of him daily, if in London,
with an autograph in the corner, briefly
accepting an invitation to dinner in these words:
"I'm your man."  I looked down upon his
handsome features, as he was fading away from
life, and kissed him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Poynter
</span>
</p>

<p>
Edward Poynter succeeded to the President's
chair, which had only been occupied by
Millais briefly.  It was during his reign that I
had the honour at the Royal Academy Banquet
to respond for the Drama: the toast had only
once been proposed before, when Irving replied.
It was a difficult task, and the greatness of the
audience impressed me with my own littleness.
Wisely, I am sure, I limited myself to five
minutes only, and venture to give an extract
from what I said:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I was not unmindful that the proposal of
this toast at that great banquet was a mark of
respect to the stage which could only make the
stage the more respect itself.  I could not
speak in that room&mdash;surrounded as I was by
the rulers in that fairyland&mdash;without some
attempt, however faint, to say that my
admiration of the beautiful art, so splendidly
illustrated year by year upon those walls, was as
true as my love for the living pictures we
players tried to paint.  Our pictures, alas!
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
died early, for the greatest actor's work must
be a passing triumph; it was not cut in marble,
nor did it live on canvas, but could only owe
its fame to written records and traditions.
Vast wealth might keep for us, and for the
ages yet to come, the undying splendour of
a Reynolds or a Millais, but no sum could
buy one single echo of the voice of Sarah
Siddons.  The drama was the most winning,
fascinating, alluring thing that ever was
conceived for the recreation of mankind.  As
England could claim to be the parent of the
drama in Europe, so could she claim to be
the mother of the greatest dramatist the
world had owned, whose mighty genius left
all art in debt that never could be paid, and
whose works alone would make the stage
eternal."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The pictures by Poynter which live clearest
in my memory are his <i>Catapult</i> and <i>Visit
to Æsculapius</i>.  Concerning the latter work
a story "went the rounds"&mdash;possibly as
untrue as many another&mdash;that two beautiful
sisters were as flattered by the eminent
painter's wish to make drawings of their
heads as they were horrified to find them
reproduced upon bodies of well-known models
in the nude.
</p>

<p>
Poynter painted a portrait of himself for
the Uffizi Gallery as Millais did.  There is an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
admirable copy of this portrait in his beloved
Garrick.
</p>

<p>
I was never really intimate with Alma
Tadema, although I knew him for many years,
beginning with the time when he lived in
Regent's Park.  Owing to an explosion of
gunpowder on the canal there, if my memory is
accurate, his house was wrecked and he went
to live in the Grove End Road, in a house
formerly occupied by Tissot, a French artist,
who had quite a vogue for a time.  Tadema
translated the house into "a thing of beauty
and a joy for ever," where he entertained a
great artistic company, worthy to be surrounded
by the <i>Roses of Heliogabalus</i>.
</p>

<p>
I owe the following painful and remarkable
story to my friend Aston Webb, lately President
of the Royal Academy; it was told to him
and others by Tadema.  A young woman, an
American, the daughter of parents of wealth
and position, was the cause of great anxiety to
her father and mother, to her intimate friends,
and to her doctor, on the score of health, which
puzzled all concerned, and became a mystery
which no one seemed able to unravel.  At
last the doctor was driven to advise a year's
absence from home and its surroundings by a
trip to Europe, to be spent where and how the
girl might wish, in the companionship of a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
female friend&mdash;she had no sisters, and the
parents could not leave their own country at
the time.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Sargent
</span>
</p>

<p>
The patient went first to London and enjoyed
her stay there.  During it, she conceived
a strong wish to be painted by her eminent
fellow-countryman, Sargent, the magician who
reveals unknowingly what have been hidden
mysteries.  The portrait when finished was
highly thought of and presently despatched
to the parents of the sitter, while she went her
way to Switzerland and Italy.  The great
artist's work delighted the father and mother.
An "at home" was arranged that their many
friends might share their admiration.  All of
this took place; among the invited guests
being the friendly doctor who had been so
puzzled by the condition of his patient.  I
will come briefly to the sad sequel.  The
doctor gazed at the portrait long and earnestly:
he left the house perturbed and saddened.  On
the following day he sought an interview with
the father, told him that Sargent had revealed
to him, beyond doubt, what he had failed to
discover himself.  Put briefly, the poor girl
afterwards died in a madhouse.  When Tadema
had finished his story, Abbey, who was also
present, quietly remarked: "All too true.  I
could tell you the names of those concerned."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
</p>

<p>
The painter who ran dear Millais close in my
appreciation, and who has given me, if I bare
my heart and tell the naked truth, greater
pleasure than any other painter, was Orchardson;
the fact that his work is so dramatic
being, I suppose, the reason.  His two phases
of the <i>Mariage de Convenance</i> were gems.  I
don't know whether Act I surpassed Act II,
or if the verdict was the other way.  The
glorious <i>Queen of the Swords</i>, <i>The Challenge</i>,
<i>Hard Hit</i>, <i>The Young Duke</i>, <i>Napoleon in the
Bellerophon</i>, <i>The First Cloud</i>, with their
exquisite colourings, the secret of which never
seems to have been divulged; and still one
other, so delicate in conception, so perfect
in its pathos, <i>Her Mother's Voice</i>.  What a
story!  How simply told!
</p>

<p>
Edwin Abbey was also a painter who appealed
strongly to me; again, because he was
dramatic.  His <i>Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and
the Lady Anne</i>, I always looked upon with
admiration.  The splendour of its colouring is
lost to me, for I see it now only <i>en gravure</i>.
Nor can his <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>King Lear</i> be forgotten,
while his decorative work was magnificent and
will preserve his fame.  He had great charm
as host and guest.
</p>

<p>
I travel back to the far-off days when W. P. Frith,
an old friend, was the popular Academician
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
of his time; his pictures of the <i>Derby
Day</i> and <i>Ramsgate Sands</i> having to be "railed
in" at the Annual Exhibition, which was then
held in the National Gallery, to protect them
from the crowd.
</p>

<p>
Frith, I remember, was struck with the
beauty of our production of the <i>School for
Scandal</i>, which he highly praised.  In its
acting and historical accuracy he said it was
like the last edition of a grand book, the
handsomest and the best.  He fell in love with the
minuet, and said it took him back to the days
of his great-grandmother.  The minuet, which
was introduced at Lady Sneerwell's "rout,"
was the brilliant idea of my wife: it was
danced by two couples in a crowded room of
guests.  I have since seen it danced by a crowd
to an otherwise empty stage.
</p>

<p>
I look back with interest to pleasant times
spent in the company of Hubert Herkomer,
that "jack-of-all-trades and master of many."  His
versatility was bewildering.  Tools of every
kind and shape seemed to be playthings in
his hands; he grasped them with firmness
and used them with skill; painting, engraving,
etching, and all sorts of metal work alike
came easily to him; he played the piano and
the zither, composed and wrote, and was, in
a way, a pioneer of film work.  His shoals
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
of portraits were amazing, and his fame might
rest enduringly upon his painting of <i>The Last
Muster</i>.
</p>

<p>
Briton Rivière was for many years our
friend.  We met first in the Engadine.  He
was, in my opinion, a great artist, and has
crowded my memory with his works.  I think
often of those speaking dogs in <i>The Vacant
Chair</i>, <i>Sympathy</i> and <i>Charity</i>, as I do of <i>Circe</i>
with the amorous pigs, and the majestic
<i>Daniel</i> facing the lions in their den.
</p>

<p>
I have always understood that Rivière was
within an ace of being elected President when
Millais died.
</p>

<p>
In early Bohemian days, Henry Stacey
Marks, long before he had blossomed into a
Royal Academician, was an amusing and
pleasant friend.  Years afterwards I bought,
at Christie's, the attractive panels of the <i>Seven
Ages of Man</i> which he had painted for Birket
Foster.  They were well-beloved companions
until a changed life came to me; they now
adorn the walls of the Green Room Club.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Val and Marcus
</span>
</p>

<p>
Another R.A. and old friend was Val Prinsep,
whose burly form looms from distant days,
which his name recalls.  It is easy to believe
that he was the original "Taffy" in George
du Maurier's <i>Trilby</i>.  I have a remembrance
of him in the sketch he made for his painting
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
<i>The Minuet</i>, which was inspired by our
introduction of the dance into <i>The School for Scandal</i>,
again in its turn reproduced in our act-drop
at the Haymarket Theatre.  On his return to
England after painting the Great Durbar,
when Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress
of India, he gave my wife a handsome native
bracelet, which, as a souvenir of her, I passed
on a little while ago to Marie Löhr, who married
Val's son, Anthony.
</p>

<p>
"Val" left many dear friends behind him,
with happy recollections of his worth.
</p>

<p>
Recently another friend of long standing,
Marcus Stone, left us.  He once told me an
interesting incident of his childhood, a link
with the past, when he was kissed by a very
old and well-known man named Pickersgill,
the engraver, who begged him, impressively,
always to remember that he had been kissed
by a man who once was kissed by Dr. Johnson.
It is odd to remember, in these days of petrol,
that Johnson said there were few keener
pleasures in life than being whirled along in
a post-chaise, in the company of a pretty lady,
at the average speed of ten miles an hour.
</p>

<p>
Stone owed much to his early, almost
boyish, friendship with Dickens, who engaged
him to illustrate the book he was then writing,
thereby made him known to eminent men,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
and altogether helped his career greatly.  He
was a good talker, and he read more books in
a week than I do in a year: he also had what
are called good looks and a distinguished
bearing.  Was it not written of him:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Marcus Apollo Belvedere Stone,<br>
  Stands there erect, in all his glory shone."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Sculpture
</span>
</p>

<p>
In the hope that I have not been tiresome,
I will close my remembrances of Academicians
with the names of two sculptors: one, whom
we knew with some intimacy, was Edgar
Boehm.  He chanced to be our guest on the
evening when his baronetcy was "in his
pocket," to be announced to his large circle
of friends on the following morning.
</p>

<p>
There was a beautiful work of his on the
staircase landing of the house Millais built for
himself in Kensington.  His fame rests chiefly,
I suppose, on the statue of Carlyle, near to his
Chelsea home; on the tomb of Dean Stanley;
and the statue of Wellington at Hyde Park
Corner, which replaced the old one, now at
Aldershot, that I was taken as a child to see
when it was erected&mdash;an earlier remembrance
than that I retain of the Iron Duke's funeral.
</p>

<p>
I always remember an evening as Boehm's
guest, when a lady whom I had taken down to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P89"></a>89}</span>
dinner, in answer to an opinion I timidly
expressed that it was just possible she might
be on the verge of "spoiling" her two boys,
who chanced to be at Eton with my son,
turned upon me with the amazing question:
"Do you think I can ever sufficiently
apologise to them for my share in bringing them
into this world?"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Boehm and Onslow Ford
</span>
</p>

<p>
Boehm's end was distressing.  He was a
great Court favourite, and one afternoon, in
his studio, told his man that he expected
a visit from the Princess Louise, and that Her
Royal Highness, with her lady, was to be
conducted to the studio at once.  When taken
there, on the door being opened, they found
Boehm, who had sunk upon the floor from a
sudden heart attack, unconscious and just
breathing; he passed away in a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
Onslow Ford, another friend of ours, was as
well known for his personal charm as for the
refinement of his work.  He was beloved by
his brother Academicians, the features of
several of whom he has immortalised in
marble, and by a large circle of friends.  One
of his best achievements is the seated figure
of Henry Irving, now in the Guildhall Picture
Gallery; while the Christopher Marlowe
memorial at Canterbury, the Shelley memorial
in University College, Oxford, and the great
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
statue of Gordon, mounted on a camel, at
Chatham, will make his fame secure.
</p>

<p>
Another sculptor whose friendship we enjoyed
was the late Count Gleichen, who regarded
his art as far more than a recreation; and
his statue of King Alfred at Wantage is the
work of no mere amateur.  We found it an
interesting experience to sit to him for the two
portrait busts which are now in the Garrick
Club.  The sittings in his studio at St. James's
Palace were often enlivened by visits from
well-known people of many kinds, which I
hope did not detract from the merit of the
sculptor's work.
</p>

<p>
I dare not try the patience of my readers
by attempting at any length to write of that
rebellious, capricious, tempestuous, and
captivating genius "Jimmy" Whistler.
</p>

<p>
After welcoming him as our amusing and
interesting guest, my wife and I were bidden
to one of his historic luncheons at the White
House, which then stood quite alone in Chelsea
by the river.  We had excellent company and
ate buckwheat cakes, cooked by himself.
</p>

<p>
His despotic value of himself was exalted
and could not be excelled: nothing shook it.
The rapier and the bludgeon were alike his
weapons of either attack or defence.
</p>

<p>
I believe his portrait of Irving as King
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
Philip has varied in different markets from
bids of a few pounds to some thousands.

"Punch"
</span>
</p>

<p>
Sir John Tenniel was an old friend and
guest.  His remarkable connection with <i>Punch</i>
extended over fifty years.  During this
marvellous record he contributed between two and
three thousand cartoons to its pages.  The
most famous of this vast collection was,
perhaps, <i>Dropping the Pilot</i>, which showed
Bismarck leaving the Ship of State, while his new
chief, who was to wreck Europe, looked
superciliously down on him.
</p>

<p>
I was present at a banquet given in his
honour upon his retirement.  The company
gathered was exceptional and was presided
over by Mr. Balfour, as he then was.  When
Tenniel rose to return his thanks, the
demonstration was too much for the old man; he
was unable to speak, and resumed his seat
in tears.  As the chairman said at once, no
expression of thanks could have been more
eloquent.
</p>

<p>
We knew George du Maurier for many
years: I wish it had been more intimately.
After his early days in Paris and his familiarity
with the Quartier Latin, his connection with
<i>Punch</i> began, ten years later than Tenniel's.
Soon afterwards he succeeded to Leach's
prominent position and earned his world-wide
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
fame, which was not lessened by his novels,
<i>Peter Ibbetson</i> and <i>Trilby</i>.
</p>

<p>
I should have loved to hear him say at one
of the weekly <i>Punch</i> dinners, as the man who
told me did: "Fellows will write to me as
<i>de</i> Maurier; I wish they'd give the devil his
du."
</p>

</span>
</p>

<p>
One of du Maurier's closest friends was that
fascinating man Canon Ainger, Master of the
Temple, with whom I had only a slight acquaintance.
They met constantly, almost daily, in
their beloved Hampstead, and indeed haunted
its Heath: du Maurier was at home in Bohemia;
Ainger had never stood upon its soil; while
their widely separated religious views never
hurt their friendship.  "A strange world, my
masters."
</p>

<p>
He loved the stage.  Would he had lived
to see the position of its leader in England,
to-day, achieved by his son Gerald!
</p>

<p>
"Sammy," as Linley Sambourne was
affectionately called by his intimates, will
complete my trio of <i>Punch</i> draughtsmen.
</p>

<p>
He was an amusing little creature, always
very horsey in get up.  I have his gift of the
first drawing from his pencil which appeared
in <i>Punch</i>, so long ago as 1867, when he was but
twenty-two; it is a droll little sketch of George
Honey as Eccles, John Hare as Sam Gerridge,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
and myself as Captain Hawtree in <i>Caste</i>.  He
told me that it was drawn from memory, after
visits to the pit when Robertson's comedy
was at the height of its first success.
</p>

<p>
I recall an amusing incident which occurred
at a fancy-dress ball, largely attended by the
artistic and "Bohemian" world.  "Sammy"
appeared, admirably appointed and dressed,
as a little fat Dutchman.  He was cheerily
greeted by Gilbert, who ran against him with
the words: "One Dutch of Sambourne makes
the whole world grin."

Pellegrini
</span>
</p>

<p>
I must write a few lines in memory of the
prince of caricaturists, Carlo Pellegrini.  We
knew him throughout his career and always
enjoyed his company.  On one evening when
he gave it to us, on being announced, he kissed
my wife's hand and uttered some compliment
in Italian; she immediately, in a spirit of fun,
rapidly recited an old and rather long
"proverb" in his language, which she had learned
by heart, as a child&mdash;it being her sole acquaintance
with Italian&mdash;the little man's expression
of amazement was a study.
</p>

<p>
She played the same trick, with still greater
effect, on the stage of the Scala Theatre at
Milan which we went over with a party of
friends, when Arthur Cecil asked her to
address an imaginary audience.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">

</span>
</p>

<p>
I sat to Pellegrini once, when he began to
paint portraits seriously&mdash;the idea was soon
abandoned.&mdash;With regard to mine he wrote:
"I have sent your <i>fac simile</i> to the Grosvenor:
I hope you will be well hanged."
</p>

<p>
I saw the "Pelican"&mdash;as Pellegrini was
called by his friends&mdash;in his last illness at
his rooms in Mortimer Street.  Shortly before
the peaceful end he said pathetically to his
faithful servant: "Wil-li-am, put me on clean
shirt&mdash;I die clean."
</p>

<p>
I hardly regarded my old friend Leslie Ward
as a caricaturist; his clever drawings were, to
my mind, portraits&mdash;humorously, but gently,
exaggerated.  They were mainly the result of
sittings.  Pellegrini's work was produced from
memory.
</p>

<p>
Leslie Ward was the son of distinguished
painters; his sister Beatrice shared their art,
as I can testify by a valued possession, a very
charming drawing of my wife.

Arthur Sullivan
</span>
</p>

<p>
The brilliant composer and musician, Arthur
Sullivan, was our much-loved friend for thirty
years.  We first knew him about the time he
and W. S. Gilbert were made known to each
other by Frederic Clay.  His great career
began, like many others, very simply, for he
was one of the "Children of the Chapel Royal,"
as they are still called, before his more serious
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
studies began at the Royal Academy of Music
and at Leipzig.  He returned with his music
to <i>The Tempest</i>, to be followed by <i>The Light of
the World</i>.
</p>

<p>
His wonderful partnership with Gilbert has
given joy to every land.  It is said that the
success of <i>H.M.S. Pinafore</i> was so amazing
in America that 100,000 barrel-organs were
specially constructed to play nothing else.
</p>

<p>
I recall a happy gathering of friends at
Pontresina.  Sullivan was one of them, and his
old mother was with him: his devotion to
her revealed a beautiful side of his affectionate
nature.
</p>

<p>
A different meeting was when my wife and
I met him one morning in the rooms at Monte
Carlo.  It was settled that we should have lunch
together at the Café de Paris, which they went
away to order, leaving me, unfortunately, at
my own request, to join them in a few minutes.
When I did so, my face must have told the
sad story of those few minutes, as Arthur
called out, cheerily: "Come along, B; this
way to the cemetery."
</p>

<p>
He had a peculiarly entrancing personality:
he lived a happy but not a long life, laden with
honours.
</p>

<p>
When I had the sad privilege of being one
of the pall-bearers at his funeral I was as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
impressed as I was pleased to see the blinds of
the Athenæum drawn as we passed on our way
to St. Paul's Cathedral, where, I have always
understood, he was laid to rest by the wish of
Queen Victoria.
</p>

<p>
Music had to bear three heavy blows, dealt
within a few days, when Charles Stanford, with
his keen sense of humour, Walter Parratt, with
his winning personality, and Frederick Bridge,
with his ever-ready stories of killing fish, left
us.  I knew them all, but Parratt was never
my guest.  He had no London home.  We met
pleasantly sometimes at the Athenæum, and
my nearest link with him was that of having
been born in the same year.  Bridge and I
received our knighthoods together.  I have
happy recollections of a stay at Harrogate
when Stanford was also there.  Although he
lived so many years in London, he seemed to
me to have left Dublin only recently; but
what lingers most firmly in my mind in regard
to him, is the majestic march he composed for
Irving when Tennyson's play <i>Becket</i> was
produced at the Lyceum.  The last time I listened
to its strains was at his own funeral service in
the Abbey.

Frederic Clay
</span>
</p>

<p>
The name of another old musical friend,
Frederic Clay, must be remembered, for it
was in his company that I met Gounod.  I
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
dined with Clay when he lived with his father,
who was the friend of Lord Beaconsfield, and
known as the finest whist-player in London.  I
once saw the old gentleman in the cardroom of
the Garrick, where he distinguished himself by
revoking.
</p>

<p>
Frederic Clay's career was checked by a long
and distressing illness.  His fame will live in
the remembrance of his melodies: "She
wandered down the Mountain Side," "The Sands
of Dee," and, above all, by the ever-enduring
"I'll sing thee songs of Araby."

<p class="intro">
"Think of the achievements of a great writer&mdash;a great
poet&mdash;their works embrace the past, the present, and the

Browning
</span>
</p>

<p>
The most prominent man of letters known to
my wife and to me was Robert Browning, who
looked as unlike the conventional idea of a
poet as I resemble a sweep; his appearance
seemed to me a better "make-up" for a
family physician or legal adviser.
</p>

<p>
Many years ago my wife and I were present
at the wedding of an old friend's daughter and
afterwards at the reception.  On entering the
drawing-room, which had heavy blinds and
was rather sombre, my wife mistook an elderly
and bearded guest for the host, went behind
him, turned his head round, and, as she
thought, kissed her congratulations to the
bride's father.  The recipient of the mistaken
salute proved to be Browning, who avowed that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
whenever and wherever he met my wife he
was to be treated in the same way.  The
ceremony was afterwards always gone through,
and more than once in the open street.
</p>

<p>
When he first dined with us he was made
happy in finding a bottle of port by his hand,
that he might help himself and not be offered
other wines.  I remember a story he told us of
Longfellow when he visited England.  The two
poets were driving in a hansom, and a heavy
shower suddenly came on.  Longfellow
insisted upon thrusting his umbrella through
the trap in the roof of the cab that the
driver might protect himself from the rain,
which he did.
</p>

<p>
At a dinner given at the old Star and Garter,
Richmond, Browning met my wife on the
terrace with an impromptu, hurriedly scrawled
on a menu, which I may give imperfectly:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Her advent was not hailed with shouts,<br>
  Nor banners, garlands, cymbals, drums;<br>
  The trees breathed gently sighs of love,<br>
  And whispered softly, 'Hush! she comes!'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In the last letter my wife received from him
he wrote: "I heartily wish I had been privileged
to begin feeling twenty years ago what I
feel now, and I shall make what amends are in
my power, by feeling so as long as I live."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
</p>

<p>
I was in the Abbey on the cheerless, foggy,
December day, when Browning joined the
"Poets" in their "Corner."
</p>

<p>
I had the honour of enjoying the friendship
of that distinguished man of letters, Monckton
Milnes, afterwards Lord Houghton.  He once
told me a story worth repeating.  He was in
search of a piece of furniture.  On entering
a dealer's shop in Wardour Street, he caught
sight of the portrait of an admiral, apparently
of the last century, and of this he asked the
price.  "Ten pounds," was the answer.  Lord
Houghton offered five; the dealer was
obdurate.  The article wanted was sought for,
found and bargained for.  On going away Lord
Houghton returned to the price of the admiral's
portrait.  At last the dealer said: "Well, my
lord, and to your lordship only, seven pound
ten"; but his customer would not go beyond
his offer of a fiver, and there was an end of the
matter.
</p>

<p>
Soon afterwards, visiting a neighbour in
Yorkshire, Lord Houghton recognised the portrait
of the admiral hanging in the dining-room,
and said: "Hallo! who's that?  What have
you got there?  Something new?"  "Yes,"
replied the friend; "he was a well-known
admiral in his day&mdash;fought with Nelson&mdash;good
bit of work too&mdash;recently bequeathed to us&mdash;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
an ancestor of my wife's."  "Ah, was he?"
said Lord Houghton.  "Six weeks ago he was
within two pound ten of becoming one of
mine!"
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Henry James
</span>
</p>

<p>
Once, at a dinner party we gave, a scrupulously
clean-shaven guest was announced, whose
name neither host nor hostess had caught.  He
shook hands gaily with us both, and as he
moved away to another couple, whom he
evidently knew, I gathered from the expression
of my wife's face that she, like myself, had no
idea of his identity.  A bachelor friend who was
next announced, after speaking familiarly with
the puzzling stranger, came back to me and
said, happily in the hearing of my wife: "Do
you like Henry James's appearance better with
or without his beard?"  The mystery was
solved.  That sort of transformation seems
hardly fair.
</p>

<p>
I beg to be forgiven if I quote a few words
from Henry James, written in <i>The Middle Years</i>:
"How can I think of the 'run' of the more
successful of Mr. Robertson's comedies at the
'dear little old' Prince of Wales's Theatre, by
Tottenham Court Road, as anything less than
one of the wonders of our age?"
</p>

<p>
Some ten years ago, James became a British
subject&mdash;many people, I dare say, have thought
him to have always been one&mdash;and in return
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
England rightly bestowed upon him the Order
of Merit.
</p>

<p>
Even at the end, when telling a friend of
the pain he suffered in his fatal illness, he was
gay, and said of death, that he felt the
distinguished thing had come to him at last.
Much the same thought doubtless crossed the
mind of Charles Frohman, the theatrical
manager, when he went down on board the
<i>Lusitania</i>.  He turned to his companion with
the words, borrowed from <i>Peter Pan</i>: "Now
for the great adventure."  Courage is
expressed in many wonderful ways.
</p>

<p>
I have mentioned my first meeting at the
elder Boucicault's with Charles Reade, author
of <i>The Cloister and the Hearth</i>.  As a man of
letters, his name is entitled to be enrolled
among the giants of his day.  Friendship with
him began at the Garrick Club, where I have
seen him at a whist table with Anthony
Trollope and Charles Lever, playing in the
same rubber.  It ripened rapidly when we
produced <i>Masks and Faces</i>, over which my
wife and I had many a fight in getting him to
agree to some important changes we wished to
make.  We won the day, and the old book was
done with for all time.  I will quote from a
superb description, written with the insight
of a gifted woman, Ellen Terry: "Dear,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
kind, unjust, generous, cautious, impulsive,
passionate, gentle Charles Reade! who
combined so many qualities, far asunder as the
poles.  He was placid and turbulent, yet
always majestic.  He was inexplicable and
entirely lovable&mdash;a stupid old dear, and as
wise as Solomon!  He seemed guileless, and
yet had moments of suspicion and craftiness
worthy of the serpent."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Wilkie Collins
</span>
</p>

<p>
Wilkie Collins was another Victorian novelist
of high repute, whose books would give great
pleasure to modern readers if they sampled
<i>The Woman in White</i>, <i>Armadale</i>, or <i>The
Moonstone</i>, and left themselves in debt to such
creations as Count Fosco, Margaret Vanstone,
Mercy Merrick, and many more.  We knew
him well, and sided with his view of the
well-known unfortunate episode in the early history
of the Garrick Club which resulted in the
expulsion of Edmund Yates, through his
youthful indiscretion in writing of Thackeray
in a way that so great a giant could have
afforded to ignore.
</p>

<p>
At the most, he might have called for an
apology&mdash;which was offered but declined.
"Wilkie" stood by Dickens in the defence of
Yates, and they resigned their membership
together.
</p>

<p>
For years Collins was a confirmed opium
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
taker and a slave to the drug.  He once left
the Engadine, in its primitive days, and found
himself, to his horror, without any.  He and an
intimate friend, who happily spoke German
like a native, were travelling together: they
represented themselves to be doctors and so
obtained from chemists at Coire, and
afterwards at Basle, the maximum supply the
Swiss law allowed, and so reached Paris
without the catastrophe Collins described in
alarming words.
</p>

<p>
At my table, Wilkie Collins, George Critchett,
who had left general practice and become an
eye specialist, and Sir William Fergusson, the
eminent Victorian surgeon, were present
together.  Critchett told Sir William that
Collins had confided to him what was the dose
of laudanum he then took every night, and
had his permission to ask Sir William if it
was not more than enough to prevent any
ordinary person from awaking.  Fergusson
replied that the dose of opium named would
suffice to kill the twelve men who sat round
the table.

<span class="sidenote">
T. W. Robertson
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is impossible for me not to recall, however
briefly, from the shadowy past the name of
T. W. Robertson, whose empty chair was left
vacant more than fifty years ago.  He was the
first of my friends to speak and write to me as
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
"B."  There are few to whom the once-famous
name of Tom Robertson now has full
meaning, although his comedies made so deep
a mark in their day and so largely influenced
the future of the stage.  Time has not
lessened my remembrance of the charm with
which he read his comedies; a melody sung
sweetly in the long-ago.  My wife was always
very proud that he dedicated to her the best
of them, his masterpiece, <i>Caste</i>.
</p>

<p>
I look back with sorrow at the small reward
he received from them, and the brief time he
enjoyed their fame.  The fees paid to dramatic
authors were miserably poor in those days,
although we advanced them materially, added
to which, there was no copyright for foreign
authors in America.  Expert shorthand writers
were cunningly scattered in different parts of
our theatre on successive nights, until the text
of Robertson's principal comedies was
completely taken down, and they were played
throughout the United States without a dollar
being sent to the author.  No wonder that
Robertson was sarcastic and bitter.
</p>

<p>
The unusual compliment of closing our
theatre when he died was, I fear, but a small
set-off against the pain he must have endured
before he once said to me: "My dear B, I
have often dined on my pipe."

Edmund Yates
</span>
</p>

<p>
Edmund Yates was an old friend.  He knew
my wife in her girlhood, and I first met him
at Epsom on the historic day, in 1867, that
Hermit won the Derby in a snowstorm.  My
mention of that incident reminds me that,
years afterwards, at a public sale, among
effects which had belonged to Mr. Baird&mdash;known
on the turf as "Mr. Abingdon"&mdash;I
came across a letter-case made from the coat
of Hermit, and so inscribed on a silver shield.
I bought it, that I might have the pleasure of
giving it, on the thirtieth anniversary of the
race, to Mr. Henry Chaplin, as he then was,
the great horse's owner.  Yates at that time
held a position in the General Post Office and
told me, soon afterwards, that he made an
early marriage upon a small income and was
handicapped for many a long year by a
domestic calamity&mdash;the birth of three sons
in eleven months.
</p>

<p>
Yates was an admirable after-dinner speaker
and story-teller, a power which doubtless owed
something to inheritance, both his parents
having held prominent positions on the stage.
At one dinner party, Edmund Yates, Dion
Boucicault and George Augustus Sala, all
being present, were asked in turn if they
regretted and repented of any "backslidings"
they had to answer for.  Boucicault at once
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
said he was sorry for his sins; Sala admitted
that he hoped some day to be sorry; Yates,
after a pause, smote the table and muttered
"No."  He was a fierce fighter.
</p>

<p>
A mutual friend was rather severely caricatured
in <i>Vanity Fair</i>.  I asked Yates what he
thought the original would say about it.
"Say, my dear B.?  He'll <i>say</i> he thinks it
delightful, but will go upstairs to his bedroom,
lock the door, and rub his head in the
hearthrug."  When his trouble came, as it did soon
afterwards, I wonder what his own conduct was.
</p>

<p>
His tragic end was connected with the
revival of a comedy in which my wife appeared
for her old friend John Hare, at the Garrick
Theatre.  Yates was seated in the centre of
the stalls, and throughout my wife's
performance had laughed and applauded heartily.
At its close, when she was loudly called for
by the audience, he gave her his last smile,
turned to his neighbour and said: "The old
brigade, the old brigade&mdash;it will take a deal
to beat it!"  He stooped for his hat, fell forward
in a fit, and never recovered consciousness.
"How oft when men are at the point of death
have they been merry!"

W. S. Gilbert

<p>
I made the acquaintance of W. S. Gilbert
during the year I spent in Liverpool; he had
just been "called" and was a briefless barrister
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
on the Northern Circuit.  Having failed to
become attached to the staff of Punch, he was
already a contributor to a comic journal called
<i>Fun</i>, in which his <i>Bab Ballads</i> first appeared.
Soon afterwards he began to write for the
theatre.  <i>The Palace of Truth</i> and <i>Pygmalion
and Galatea</i> both had great success at the old
Haymarket; the latter was perhaps a starting
point in the brilliant career of Madge Robertson
(Mrs. Kendal).

He will, of course, be best remembered
through the enduring success of the comic operas
he wrote in conjunction with Arthur Sullivan,
the most memorable of artistic partnerships.
</p>

<p>
What humorous things he was constantly
uttering!  I will endeavour to repeat one or
two which may not have been heard.  When
the beautiful Scala Theatre was built on the
site of our old Prince of Wales's, my wife was
appropriately invited to perform the opening
ceremony.  At the end of the pretty speech
she made, Gilbert joined her on the stage, and
said he had been to the back of the dress
circle, where he heard every word of it;
adding that the voice was as beautiful as ever
and that, if she continued to take pains and
work hard, she might be sure of having a great
career <i>behind</i> her.
</p>

<p>
Talking with a Mr. Such Granville, who was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P109"></a>109}</span>
on the stage and said to Gilbert: "My name
is Such, but I act as Granville," he at once
replied: "I wish your name were Granville
and you'd act as such."
</p>

<p>
A young lady who was always known as
"Nelia" was about to be married.  Gilbert
was congratulating her, adding that her
Christian name would join charmingly with
her forthcoming surname; the girl then told
him that her first name was really "Cornelia."  Gilbert
at once replied: "Oh, I see, you've
cut your corn."
</p>

<p>
Once, in my presence, Gilbert was being
questioned by an ardent playgoer as to one of
his serious plays, and was finally asked how it
ended; its author immediately answered that
it had ended in a fortnight.
</p>

<p>
On another occasion I arrived at the Garrick
Club on foot as Gilbert drove up in a hansom:
when he alighted he handed the driver
half-a-crown.  The cabman asked, "What's
this?"  Answer: "It's your fare."  Cabman: "This
ain't my fare."  Gilbert took back the
half-crown, saying: "I beg your pardon, I made a
mistake, there's your fare"&mdash;as he gave the
man a florin.  Tableau.
</p>

<p>
Someone remarked to him what an extraordinary
title Henry Arthur Jones had given
a new play of his.  Gilbert asked: "What is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
it?"  <i>The Princess's Nose</i>.  Gilbert hoped it
would "run."
</p>

<p>
The fashion of the "hobble skirt" was being
discussed in Gilbert's presence, who said that
it reminded him of the boards outside a
prospering theatre&mdash;"standing room only."
</p>

<p>
In long past days what was called a shilling
subscription was got up by the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>
as a testimonial to W. G. Grace.  At one
time there was a fine cricket ground known
as Prince's, which was a rival to the Oval
and Lord's, and stood upon the land now
occupied by Pont Street and Lennox Gardens.
At an afternoon party the question of the
testimonial was being discussed, and a young girl
asked Gilbert if Grace was anything besides a
great cricketer.  The brilliant tongue at once
replied: "Oh, yes, my dear, he is lord of
Lord's and the only ruler of Prince's."
</p>

<p>
As a rule I have been careful in the choice
of guests and successful in seating them to
ensure good companionship, for what you put
on the chairs is quite as important as what you
place on the table, but let me confess to a
terrible blunder when I invited Gilbert and
Burnand to the same dinner.  At an early stage
of it, when all was going well, a loud-voiced
guest said: "Tell me, Mr. Burnand, do you
ever receive for <i>Punch</i> good jokes and things
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
from outsiders?"  This was not long after he
had been elected to the editor's chair, and
Burnand replied, cheerfully: "Oh, often."  Gilbert
sharply grunted from the opposite side
of the table, over his knife and fork: "They
never appear!"  The rest was silence.  This is
the true version of an otherwise much-told tale.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Editors of "Punch"
</span>
</p>

<p>
The allusion to <i>Punch</i> reminds me that I can
readily tell how many weeks old I am, as we
were born in the same year; and not many
people now can say they have known all its
editors: Mark Lemon&mdash;when he was old and
I was young, Shirley Brooks&mdash;who was my
proposer at the Garrick Club, Tom Taylor,
Frank Burnand and Owen Seaman.  What
pleasure they have given, and how incomplete
the week would be without the charm of
Mr. Punch's infinite pen and pencil!
</p>

<p>
Burnand's humour was different from
Gilbert's: he excelled as a punster.  From his
earliest days he was devoted to the theatre
and founded the A.D.C. at Cambridge.  He
wrote with marvellous rapidity.  When he
saw <i>Diplomacy</i>, in the height of the play's
original success, he left the theatre, sat up
through the night, began and finished a most
amusing travesty, which he called <i>Diplunacy</i>.
</p>

<p>
Years ago my son was at Ramsgate, reading
for an examination in the law.  He met
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
Burnand, who asked what he had been doing.
George told him that he had been on the
Goodwins with his "coach."  Burnand replied
that he had no idea you could drive there!
</p>

<p>
He told me once that, in spite of every kind
of exercise, he was a slave to liver&mdash;a livery
servant.  One of the best of his many smart
things was said when he was recovering from
a serious illness.  A journalist friend paid him a
sympathetic visit, and said: "Your condition
has been so grave that my editor asked me to
write an obituary notice of you, adding that he
wished it to be generous and that I must give
you a column."  Burnand at once exclaimed:
"A column!  Why, that's all they gave Nelson."
</p>

<p>
My first meeting with Oscar Wilde was at
Oxford.  He had recently "come down," but
was visiting a friend there.  His appearance
suggested to me that he might have prompted
Disraeli to write these words, they seemed so
accurately to apply to the once spoiled darling:
"The affectations of youth should be viewed
leniently; every man has a right to be
conceited until he is successful."
</p>

<p>
I think the best plays from his pen were
<i>Lady Windermere's Fan</i> and <i>The Importance
of Being Earnest</i>.
</p>

<p>
He was talking with us about one of his
comedies, just produced, when my wife
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
remarked that the leading situation rather
reminded her of the great scene in a play by
Scribe, to which Wilde unblushingly replied:
"Taken bodily from it, dear lady.  Why not?
Nobody reads nowadays."
</p>

<p>
He once congratulated us when we wrote
some account of ourselves, on and off the stage,
on not having waited, as most people do, until
they have lost all memory.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Robert Marshall
</span>
</p>

<p>
One of many heavy blows I have naturally
had to bear during my fifty-six years' membership
of the Garrick Club was through the loss of
Robert Marshall.  His was a strange career.
The last man to imagine who could claim the
honour of rising from the ranks, through
failing to pass an examination, to be a captain in
the army.  He had left it before we met, but
was always smart and soldierly in appearance.
</p>

<p>
He wrote some charming plays, with a distinctive
quality of their own.  I recall especially
<i>A Royal Family</i>, <i>His Excellency the Governor</i>,
<i>The Second in Command</i>, and <i>The Duke of
Killiecrankie</i>.  What pleasant evenings they
gave us!  When he was stricken and his friends
knew that his lease of life was not to be
renewed, he was lying in a nursing home close
to Portland Place.  A man who loved him was
sitting by his bed-side one afternoon when
Marshall's quick ear caught the sound of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
approaching military music.  It was the band
of the Horse Guards on the way from Albany
Street barracks to a Royal function.  He
started up in bed and with a far-off look in his
eyes, his mind having travelled back to his
soldier days, listened for the last time to the
trumpets and the drums: as their sound died
away he fell back on his pillow in a flood of tears.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Henry Lucy
</span>
</p>

<p>
Henry Lucy&mdash;Toby, M.P.&mdash;was an old and
amusing friend; we often enjoyed the pleasant
parties to which Lady Lucy invited us, and
they were our guests in London and frequently
at Underlea, when they lived hard-by, at
Hythe.  Perhaps the greatest of the many
surprises I have had was the discovery that
instead of the poor journalist he was thought
to be, he left a quarter of a million.  How so
vast a fortune was accumulated has remained
a mystery to me, fostered by the fact that
during the War they discharged their servants
as a duty, and ran their cottage themselves,
with the simple help of one old woman and
then only once in a week.  However his
wealth was achieved, it was hardly by such
means as those of a brother journalist, a wily
Scot, who, when he was seen coming out of a
telegraph office by a friend, who knew his
penurious ways and asked: "Surely, Mac,
you've not been wasting your money in sending
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
telegrams?" replied: "Not I, mon, I've only
been giving my fountain pen a drink!"
</p>

<p>
Lucy was an odd looking little creature,
with his hair standing straight up, reminding
me of some strange bird that might have
escaped from the zoo.  I remember his telling
me once that, when dining with Lord
Rothschild, he arrived late, jumped from a hansom,
ran up the steps, flung his Inverness cape into
the arms of a footman, but, as he passed his
hand through his hair, was stopped from
entering the dining-room by a stately butler, who
told him, pointing to a door, that he would
find brushes in his lordship's dressing-room.
</p>

<p>
On the occasion of one of his visits to us,
the talk turned upon Forbes-Robertson's
acting in <i>The Passing of the Third Floor Back</i>.
Lucy told my wife that he had not yet seen
the play, but much wished to do so, and would
she tell him the story.  To the amazement of
those who heard her, she gave the most perfect
and dramatic illustration I have ever listened
to&mdash;if I may use the expression, she seemed to
be inspired.  We sat spell-bound as the various
incidents were unfolded and brought to a
wonderful climax.  After a pause, Lucy rose
from his chair, took her hand, and said:
"Good-bye, my dear; there is no need for
me to see the play."

<p>
For the egotism which is bound to occur in a
book of this sort it is useless to offer excuses
or apology; it must have its sway.
</p>

<p>
My wife one day on returning from an afternoon
party, to which I was unable to go, in
answer to my question: "Who were there?"
humorously replied: "Oh, ladies and other
dukes."  The phrase came to stay&mdash;being
often used by us.  In writing further of
departed guests&mdash;"Shadows of the things that
have been"&mdash;it will constantly be on my
tongue.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Prince Francis of Teck
</span>
</p>

<p>
I enjoyed the acquaintanceship of Prince
Francis of Teck, who was certainly a man of
mark, at a social club as well as at the Middlesex
Hospital, of which he was the energetic
chairman.  Having been a member of the weekly
board for more than thirty years, I ought to
know something of the value of his services
and devotion to the welfare of that institution.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
My wife first met the Prince in the Engadine,
long before he was our guest; in fact, when
he was a boy on a visit to St. Moritz, in the
company of his mother, the Duchess of Teck,
his sister, Queen Mary, and other members of
his family.
</p>

<p>
The Prince was a good soldier, and bore
himself well, with an air of command.  He
served with distinction in Egypt and South
Africa.
</p>

<p>
He died at forty, or thereabouts.  I saw him
in the Welbeck Street nursing home before
he succumbed to that enemy, even of the
robust, pneumonia, and was one of the
deputation from the hospital bidden to Windsor,
where he was buried.
</p>

<p>
I now find myself up against a duke.  There
is no need to dwell at any length on the name
of his late Grace of Beaufort, beyond saying
that he was a great lover of the stage and gave
us his friendship.  (I mean the grandfather of
the present Duke.)
</p>

<p>
When it became known that my wife and
I had decided to abandon the old Prince of
Wales's Theatre, and had a lease of the
Haymarket, a movement was set on foot, in which
the Duke took a prominent part, to present
us with a "testimonial."  That sort of thing
was always obnoxious to me; and, happily,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
the intention came to my ears in time for me
to bring it to a prompt end.
</p>

<p>
Referring to our farewell night at the
Haymarket Theatre, later on, the Duke wrote to
my wife:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Do you know, I feel it to be too melancholy
an occasion to assist at.  I should hate it
all the time.  Some day, when you both play for
a benefit or a charity, I hope to be there to
welcome you.  Let me say how very much I
regret your determination to retire from
management.  What a loss I feel it, and how sure
I am the general public share that feeling."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Another duke!&mdash;but merely a viscount
when he sat at our table&mdash;Viscount Macduff, a
close friend of Horace Farquhar, whose name
reminds me of his amusing brother Gilbert,
generally known as "Gillie" Farquhar.  Gillie,
when it was rumoured that he intended to
go on the stage, was angrily sent for by Horace,
his elder and prosperous brother, who loudly
expostulated on such a step being taken,
but learned from Gillie that he was quite in
earnest.  Horace then thundered: "Of course
you will take some other name.  What do
you mean to call yourself?"  Gillie quietly
replied: "I have thought of calling myself
Mr. <i>Horace</i> Farquhar!"
</p>

<p>
When we first knew Macduff we were neighbours,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
and constantly saw him lead his father,
the old and infirm Earl of Fife, into the garden
of Cavendish Square, where tea was taken
across the road to them.
</p>

<p>
I was invited to dine at No. 4 one Sunday
evening, but had to be elsewhere with my wife,
so asked leave to join the party later, as I
knew it would not be an early one.  When I
entered the room a young man was standing
in the middle, giving an imitation of myself.
When he had finished I was made acquainted
with Herbert Tree.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lord Londesborough
</span>
</p>

<p>
Lord Londesborough, the first earl, was also
a keen playgoer.  For years he and Lady
Londesborough showed us thoughtful kindness.
Our theatre did not seem to be complete if
they were not present on a "first night."
</p>

<p>
With reference to the farewell performance
of <i>Caste</i>, which had an added interest from
Hare's coming to us, from his own theatre,
to play his original part, Lord Londesborough
wrote: "The demonstration was most thoroughly
well deserved, for there is no one to
whom the stage, and therefore the country,
owes more than to you and to Mrs. Bancroft.
It is always satisfactory when the public shows
its appreciation of those who do their work,
and make their mark, without beat of drum
and flourish of trumpets."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
</p>

<p>
He was a great "whip" and a prominent
member of the Coaching Club.  I was of his
joyous party to the Derby for a number of
years, until his sight failed him through an
accident while shooting; and I remember his
telling my wife, in the later years of his life,
that the remaining eye was saved by a
consultation held at Lord's between C. I. Thornton,
W. G. Grace and myself.  I was fond of
cricket in those days, and became a member
of the M.C.C. before it was necessary to be
proposed in boyhood.
</p>

<p>
On one occasion I drove with our kind friend
to Ascot.  While seated in a prominent position
on the front of his coach, helping a group of
gorgeously-dressed ladies to lobster salad, I
felt someone touching my toe; on looking
down I saw a well-known "nigger," who for
years frequented the race-courses.  He held up
his tambourine to me and called out, with a
grin: "Now, Mr. B, don't forget the perfession!"
</p>

<p>
These Men of Mark who gave me the joy
of their friendship are more numerous than
I had looked for, and the names of those left
to me must not be dwelt upon.  I cannot
ignore, however, the delightful and unique
dinners enjoyed in Whitehall with the late
Lord Onslow, when Members from both
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
Houses streamed in and sat, informally, at
separate tables, reinforced by men prominent
in other walks of life.  As an example, I once
was placed in the company of the Archbishop
of Canterbury and Mr. Balfour, as he then
was.  Onslow was a delightful host and a
delightful guest.  I have never forgotten his
saying to me that very few men, even eminent
men, had any idea who their great-grandfathers
were.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lord Rowton
</span>
</p>

<p>
Few more attractive men have graced a
table than Lord Rowton: we knew him first
as Montagu Corry.  Later on he became a
next door neighbour: our No. was 18, his 17.
In his courtly way he said to my wife we ought
to change houses, so that he might address her
as "sweet seventeen," and not as his "dear
neighbour."  It is, to my pen, difficult to
describe his pervasive charm, which I am sure
was as manifest in simple homes as at
Balmoral.  He always appeared to be gay, never
boisterous, and his devotion to his great chief,
Disraeli, must have been priceless.
</p>

<p>
I was told by an eminent authority for many
years at the bar, my friend Sir Edward Clarke,
that in his early days he "read" in chambers
where "Monty" Corry was his companion.
The career of my informant speaks for his
diligence; and he assured me that Corry
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
chiefly passed his time in making rhymes on
the names which appeared in <i>The Times</i> of
the day in the column restricted to the
announcements of "hatches," "matches" and
"despatches"!
</p>

<p>
Two other things about this dear man occur
to me.  He told me, after the great
fancy-dress ball given at Devonshire House on a
State event, that he was at the head of the
staircase when Irving arrived, and was struck
with the impression that the actor alone of
all the distinguished crowd wore his robes (he
went as a cardinal) as if they were his daily
garb, and not obviously hired from a costumier's
store, or made for the occasion.
</p>

<p>
My last remembrance of Rowton is on
leaving a club with him one night to walk
home; he suddenly stood still on the way and,
after a pause, said, as if dreaming of secrets
under mental lock and key: "I seem to have
passed the whole of my life in holding my
tongue."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
"Jacky" Fisher
</span>
</p>

<p>
At the hospitable board of mutual friends we
first met Sir John and Lady Fisher, as they
then were.  The great Admiral took my wife
down to dinner, and from that evening was her
good friend and mine.  Others at the table,
I remember, were the scientist Lord Kelvin
and Canon Ainger, the Master of the Temple.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
Fisher accepted an invitation to dine with me
in these words: "On the 25th, with pleasure.
Yours till hell freezes, J. F."  His bad
language was really only a not very bad habit&mdash;his
bark was infinitely worse than his bite; in
fact, he was a deeply religious man, as a
beautiful letter he wrote to my wife when Lady
Fisher died would testify.  He knew much of
the Bible, and quotations from it were as often
on his lips as were his stock phrases.  A friend
of mine told me that he was once as astounded
to hear the old Sea Lord preach a sermon in
the Duke of Hamilton's private chapel as he
was by its excellence.  Whenever he caught
sight of me, no matter where, Lord Fisher
would call out, cheerily, "How's the vintage?"
</p>

<p>
When Queen Alexandra shared King Edward's
throne, Lord Fisher paid Her Majesty
a pretty compliment when offering his
congratulations on her sixtieth birthday.  "Have
you seen, Ma'am," he asked, "the paper which
says: 'Her Majesty is sixty years old to-day;
may she live till she looks it!'  The words
were his own, but he thought it would please
the Queen more to believe that the compliment
had been paid to her publicly.  Soon afterwards,
the Queen cut out from an illustrated
catalogue the figure of a little girl, stuck on
the top of it a portrait of her own head, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
wrote underneath it: "May she live till she
looks it!" and sent it to Lord Fisher.
</p>

<p>
This reminds me of a compliment that I
will dare to mention, paid to me by Alfred
Sutro on my eightieth birthday, when he ended
a charming letter with these words: "But
then, my dear B, you are not really eighty,
you are only forty for the second time."
</p>

<p>
We did not know that dandy of the Senior
Service, Lord Alcester, until he had retired
upon his laurels and left the planks of an
ironclad for the pavement of St. James's
Street, of which his lavender kid gloves seemed
to be a daily part, and had earned for him his
gorgeous nickname, the "Swell of the Ocean."
</p>

<p>
It was as Beauchamp Seymour that he so
ably served his country, the height of his
career being the brilliant success of his
bombardment of Alexandria, which gave him his
Peerage, and doubtless paved the way to our
occupation of Egypt.  It is interesting to
know that two of his captains at the time were
named John Fisher and Charles Beresford.
</p>

<p>
The first Admiral Sir Edward Inglefield
was our neighbour fifty years ago, and many a
nautical salute have we exchanged "over the
garden wall."  As a "handy man" I never
met his equal.  If a pane of glass in house
or conservatory was broken he replaced it; if
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
the kitchen clock stopped he soon made it go
again; if a chimney took to smoking it soon
gave up the habit through his means.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Lady Inglefield used to
say that the punctuality with which she heard
our wheels at night, when we returned from
work, regulated her movements.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Sheridan's Granddaughter
</span>
</p>

<p>
At a garden party given by them we met
the celebrated Mrs. Norton, the granddaughter
of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, famous alike
for her poetry and novels, and for her unhappy
relations with her mean and cruel husband.
She was still a beautiful woman in the sixties,
and it was easy to believe that she was the
granddaughter of the lovely Elizabeth Linley.
Time had then all but obliterated the old and
untrue scandal that she had sold to <i>The Times</i>
the news of Peel's conversion to Free Trade,
and his intention to get the Corn Laws repealed.
George Meredith's novel, <i>Diana of the Crossways</i>,
had (though wholly against the author's
will) done something to revive the false report
that, for her own financial ends, Caroline
Norton had wormed the secret out of Sidney
Herbert; the truth being that Delane had been
told it by Lord Aberdeen himself, who intended
him to publish it.
</p>

<p>
On one occasion, when Sir Edward was in
command of one of our fleets, he condemned
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
a man to receive so many strokes from the
lash, and was on deck to see the sentence
carried out.  When the delinquent approached
he made certain signs known to Freemasons.
"Oh," said the Admiral, "a Mason, eh?  Well,
I doubt if you're better at that job than as a
seaman.  Go down and take your punishment."
</p>

Garnet Wolseley
</span>
</p>

<p>
Having written of Lord Fisher, a great
sailor, I will now turn my attention to a great
soldier, whom we first knew, fifty years ago,
as Sir Garnet Wolseley.  We became friends
and later on were neighbours.
</p>

<p>
To my regret, I only had a club acquaintance
with Lord Roberts, who was too true a gentleman
ever to murmur: "I told you so&mdash;why
did you not listen to me?"  The same with
Lord Kitchener; we only knew him as a
fellow-guest at other people's tables.  It was a
Frenchman who wrote this tribute on his sad
end, which staggered the country: "Great
England's valiant soldier needed a nobler
tomb than a hole in the ground, and he had
the noblest of all tombs.  God ordered his
funeral; the waves sang his requiem; the
organ-pipes were rocky cliffs; his pall was the
black sky, foam the flowers, and the lightning
his funeral torches."
</p>

<p>
Wolseley was, I repeat, a great soldier.  One
of those leaders whom men will follow&mdash;even
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
unto death.  These words were written before
the powerful biography written by two friends
of mine, Sir Frederick Maurice and Sir George
Arthur, was published.  I think he saw service
even before the Crimean War, where, as little
more than a boy, he became Captain, and was
almost cut to pieces by bullets.  Then came
Lucknow and service in many lands.  He was
a Lieutenant-Colonel when twenty-six; and
throughout his long career honours of all
kinds poured on him.  He became Commander-in-Chief,
but was not destined to have realised
the wish expressed to my wife&mdash;"I hope I
shall never die in a bed."  There was something
about him, about that slight cheerful figure,
and that glowing face, that outspoken talk, that
was very helpful and strengthening: he seemed
in some way to shed happiness round him.
</p>

<p>
Among the accumulated correspondence we
found waiting after a holiday in 1882 was a
cheery letter from Wolseley, postmark
Alexandria, August 18th, in which he wrote:
"The 'army' keeps arriving daily, and I
hope very soon to be in a position to bring
Mr. Arabi to book."  The realisation of this
prophecy, and the curious incident of an
atmospheric phenomenon caused by the comet
of that year, prompted some verses, that were
sent to the hero of the achievement and thus
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
acknowledged from the War Office: "I am
very glad Bancroft induced you to send me
your lines on Tel-el-Kebir, for I like them
extremely.  The word-painting is admirable,
and the whole incident is told most feelingly
and well.  I shall put the little poem away
among my treasures.  Many, many thanks for
it."  I wonder where it is now.  He was a
shockingly bad speller&mdash;double pp's and double
ll's were sure to be found where they were not
wanted.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A rebuff
</span>
</p>

<p>
I was told of a terrible rebuff Wolseley
brought upon himself on an occasion when he
took Madame Melba down to dinner, not
having, most unfortunately, caught her name
when presented.  He neglected her at table
and devoted himself to a charming lady on his
other side, whom he knew well.  After a time
he asked&mdash;as was rather his habit&mdash;too loudly,
"Who is my other neighbour?"  "Surely
you know Madame Melba," was the answer.
"Only heard of her: never met her before:
did not catch her name: when I brought her
down she conveyed nothing to me."  At last
he turned to the great songstress and addressed
some casual remark to her.  Melba quietly
asked: "To whom am I speaking?"  He
answered: "General Wolseley," and received
the reply: "I am afraid the name conveys
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
nothing to me."  I hope Dame Nellie Melba
will forgive me for repeating the story.
</p>

<p>
Writing of Wolseley reminds me of another,
his comrade, Sir Redvers Buller, for years,
with Lady Audrey, our friend and neighbour.
Buller was a man of unflinching courage and
dogged bravery: it was said that he had won
his Victoria Cross three times over.
</p>

<p>
He invited me to join a congratulatory
dinner party to be given by him, at a military
club, in honour of Wolseley having been made a
Field-Marshal.  All the guests turned up except
Wolseley, who had received a late summons
from Windsor, commanding him to dine at the
Castle, as Her Majesty wished to present the
<i>bâton</i> to him in person on that very evening.
</p>

<p>
A long spell of years has passed since my
wife and I were guests at what was then
Thomas's Hotel, in Berkeley Square, now
converted into flats, and met Evelyn Wood
when he was about thirty, having already
won the V.C. in the Indian Mutiny, after
beginning his adventurous career as a
midshipman and being wounded in the Crimea.
We lost sight of him for a long while, and he
must have become a Field-Marshal when he
dined with us, as he often did, until increasing
deafness made him cautious of accepting such
invitations.  He amused us once by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
threatening to recite the Lord's Prayer in an alarming
number of languages if provoked.
</p>

<p>
Another Field-Marshal and V.C. whom we
knew was the hero of Ladysmith, Sir George
White.  I met him first on board a P. &amp;
O. steamer when he was Governor of Gibraltar.
We walked many a mile together on the deck of
the <i>Arabia</i>.  Both he and Lady White were
very kind to me when I landed from his
launch for a short stay on the Rock, and
enabled me to be present at a memorial service
for the Duke of Cambridge.  When his own
time came White was Governor of Chelsea
Hospital.  His body was taken across London,
for burial in his native Ireland, to such a tribute
of affection and regard from his comrades and
the people as is rarely given.
</p>

<p>
I first knew the popular old soldier and father
of the charming Lady Burnham and Lady
Somerleyton, Sir Henry de Bathe, in the early
days of my membership of the Garrick, and
was so struck by his appearance that I did my
best to suggest it in a part I played soon
afterwards&mdash;I suppose with a measure of success,
for when I stepped upon the stage Lady de
Bathe (now the Dowager, still, happily, strong
and well), who was seated in the stalls,
exclaimed audibly, "Why, it's Henry!"
</p>

<p>
My wife was so impressed by a dramatic
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P131"></a>131}</span>
story the old general told of his Crimean days,
that she often repeated it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A convict from Eton
</span>
</p>

<p>
One evening, in the severe winter time, it
was de Bathe's duty to direct the clearing
of the dead and wounded after a deadly
encounter with the enemy, the brunt of which
had been borne by men drawn from the French
convict settlements, who were thrust into the
hottest places when trying work had to be
done.  The searching party came across one
poor fellow who was grievously wounded but
still alive: de Bathe had him placed upon a
stretcher, lifted his head, and poured brandy
into the soldier's mouth.  The man took his
hand and pressed it, murmuring in English,
"Thank you, de Bathe."  Thunderstruck, he
stooped down and asked how a Frenchman
knew his name and could also speak such
perfect English.  The wounded man smiled and
whispered, "Eton!" as he fainted; de Bathe
accompanied the stretcher to the French lines,
saying that he would return as soon as his
duty would allow him.  He did so, but the
man was dead; de Bathe lifted the sheet
from his face and gazed upon it earnestly
without recognising the lost creature, once his
school companion, then known only as a
French convict with a fictitious name.
</p>

<p>
I remember being once so fortunate, when
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
the old general dined with me, as to place
him between Sir William Howard Russell, the
war correspondent, and Dion Boucicault, the
dramatist, and to learn that all three of them
in boyhood's days had been at the same school
together in Dublin.
</p>

<p>
Lord Rathmore&mdash;better remembered and
thought of by me as David Plunket&mdash;was a
fascinating creature.  What otherwise could
he be with such youthfulness, brightness,
wit&mdash;such qualities as earned for him the
friendship of the sphinx-like Disraeli?
</p>

<p>
Our acquaintance with him began many
years ago at Homburg, where we had a happy
time, and continued until 1915, when, with his
company and that of other pleasant people, my
wife and I passed a holiday at the old Queen
Hotel, on The Stray, at Harrogate.  He was
a delightful guest, an arresting personality
at any table, and one of the most gifted
orators&mdash;I can use no smaller word&mdash;I have
listened to; his highly polished sentences
being rendered even more attractive by his
sometimes pronounced stammer, which often
added charm to his brilliant flow of language.
David Plunket's many friends at his favourite
club, the Garrick, where he was beloved,
missed him greatly and mourned his loss.
</p>

<p>
Lord Glenesk, always a great supporter of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
the drama, gave us his friendship for many
years.  As Sir Algernon Borthwick, he was,
to our great delight, at Balmoral when we
were commanded by the late Queen to act
there.  From his house in Piccadilly, we saw
both joyful and mournful processions.  In a
letter to my wife he wrote: "You were the
first to teach the school of Nature, and not
only by your own bright impersonations, but
also by your influence over all those with whom
you were brought in contact, to prove that
English art is second to none."
</p>

<p>
Acquaintance with the first Lord Ashbourne,
so long Lord Chancellor of Ireland, began years
ago in the Engadine, and I recall happy times
spent there and by the Lake of Como in his
excellent company.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Edward Carson
</span>
</p>

<p>
We were dining with him one evening when
my wife asked who was a young man at the
farther end of the table.  "Oh," said her host,
"his name is Carson.  He is a fellow-countryman
of mine, who has just been called to the
English Bar, where he means to practise."  "And
where he will go far, if I am any judge of
a face," was my wife's reply.  Lord Ashbourne
brought the "young Irishman" to her afterwards,
and so an affectionate and enduring
friendship with the brilliant advocate, the
valiant patriot, Lord Carson, had its birth.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
</p>

<p>
I was one of four who made up a table with
Lord Ashbourne&mdash;who was gay and amusing&mdash;to
play bridge at the Athenæum on the day
before he was stricken.
</p>

<p>
I first met Edward Lawson, afterwards
Lord Burnham, on the morning of my wedding
day, which chanced to be his birthday.  My
wife had made his acquaintance before, as
also that of his sage old father, who founded
the fortunes of the great newspaper, of which
three generations have now been justly proud.
</p>

<p>
I gratefully remember that it is to the
senior of the trio the stage owes much of its
present recognition by the press.  To digress
for a moment, it was well that Clement Scott,
young and enthusiastic, was given his head,
and for a long while&mdash;years, in fact&mdash;his virile
pen was devoted to the service of the drama.
</p>

<p>
Lord Burnham continued in his father's
footsteps, as, in his turn, his own son has done.
I remember hearing Burnham say, when asked
if there was any particular advantage in being
very rich: "Only one; you can afford to be
robbed."
</p>

<p>
I was indebted to his constant kindness and
hospitality, especially at Hall Barn, for little
short of fifty years, until the war broke his
splendid spirit and claimed him as its victim.
</p>

<p>
Of my friend since his boyhood, the present
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P135"></a>135}</span>
Viscount, I will only say, although I can hardly
believe it, that I have given him a sovereign
when he went back to Eton!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Alfred Lyttelton
</span>
</p>

<p>
My first acquaintance with Alfred Lyttelton
was as a spectator at Lord's, in the field, and
in the courts.  Before I knew him I had the
privilege of two well-remembered talks with
Miss Laura Tennant, whose beauty and charm
left a lasting impression.  His career, political
and otherwise, is too well known to need a
word from me.  The widespread popularity he
enjoyed began early.  He was captain of both
his school and university elevens, and held
the tennis championship without a break for
many years.
</p>

<p>
A personal note I can strike with this most
lovable man is through going with him in
Paris to see one of the earliest performances
of <i>Cyrano</i> by Coquelin.  He also did me the
honour to take the place of Sir Henry Thompson
as my seconder at the Athenæum.
</p>

<p>
Alfred Lyttelton was spared the agonies of
the Great War and the bewildering sense of
uncertainty as to what will result from it in
this much-altered world.  On the day he was
buried, in July, 1913, the Oxford and
Cambridge match was being played at Lord's.
At the solemn hour the game was stopped, and
the great assemblage stood uncovered as they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
thought of him.  Later, on the same day,
Mr. Asquith said of him in the House of
Commons that he, perhaps of all men of this
generation, came nearest to the ideal of
manhood which every English father would like
to see his son aspire to and attain.
</p>

<p>
It is among my happy memories to have
been many times the guest of that prince of
hosts, Sir Henry Thompson, extending over
twenty years.  No dinner parties were more
justly celebrated than the "octaves," generally
eight guests and himself, he arranged with so
much thought and knowledge.
</p>

<p>
He was an exceptional, an extraordinary,
man, in addition to his skill as a great surgeon.
He had talent as a painter, had pictures hung
in both the Academy and the Salon; he
wrote novels, and his knowledge of old Nanking
china, of which he owned a fine collection,
was that of an expert; and he was founder and
president of the Cremation Society.  He
introduced me to motoring, when it was in its
infancy.  He was an enthusiast in astronomy,
having a private observatory erected by
himself.  He gave a valuable book on this subject
to my wife with the inscription: "Homage
from an Astronomer to a Star of the First
Magnitude."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Public servants
</span>
</p>

<p>
Other names crowd my mind: Sir Frank
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P137"></a>137}</span>
Lascelles, so long our Ambassador in Berlin,
and Sir Rivers Wilson, also a distinguished
public servant&mdash;delightful hosts, delightful
guests&mdash;both great gentlemen, and both
devoted to cards as an amusement.  The
former cursed them (never his partner) when
they persistently went against him; the latter
caressed them, however badly they treated him.
</p>

<p>
Of Schomberg McDonnell, known better to
his big circle of friends as "Pom," I recall one
personal incident.  He was the first to
congratulate me on my knighthood, through being
at the time Lord Salisbury's private secretary,
a post which he had the courage to give up to
take his part in the South African War, where
he did good service with the C.I.V., and was
rewarded on his return by being reinstated.
He again served his country in the Great War
and died from his wounds, beloved and
regretted.
</p>

<p>
I must in these names include that of a
friend of many years, Sir Thomas Sutherland,
so long the chairman of the P. &amp; O. Company.
To the kindness of his invitations to be a guest
on trial trips of ships of that great fleet I owe
the happiest "week-ends," in wonderful
company, I have ever spent.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Alfred," as Alfred de Rothschild was
generally spoken of, was once our guest;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
we were often his in Seamore Place.  I was
invited to join a week-end party, when I
might have seen the wonders of his country
home, with its circus and performing animals,
but I could not go.  Being delicate and of a
highly nervous temperament, he must have
been a mine of wealth to members of the
medical profession.  He was a great lover and
patron of the theatre.  I remember a peculiar
incident concerning him when we revived
Robertson's comedy <i>School</i> at the Haymarket.
Sometimes for several nights running,
sometimes twice in a week, he took a large stage
box, occupied it for not more than half an
hour, sat alone to see the second act of the
comedy, and then went.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Burton and Stanley
</span>
</p>

<p>
The two famous travellers and explorers,
Burton and Stanley, were old friends of ours.
I couple their names because it so chanced
that we saw the most of them, and more
intimately, together with Lady Burton and
Lady Stanley, in hotels&mdash;one in Switzerland,
the other in Italy&mdash;when we were all holiday
making.
</p>

<p>
Burton's early career was that of a wild,
untamed gipsy spirit.  His childhood was
passed in France and Italy, when his mastery
of tongues began.  At Oxford he acquired
Arabic, having turned his back on Latin and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
Greek.  He told me that, eventually, he
conquered well over thirty languages&mdash;I forget
the exact number&mdash;as well as made progress
towards interpreting what he called the speech
of monkeys.  We first met him at the table of a
dear friend, Dr. George Bird, who asked how
he felt when he had killed a man.  Burton
replied that the doctor ought to know, as he
had done it oftener.
</p>

<p>
Stanley's fame was chiefly established by
his "finding" of Livingstone, when he was
only about thirty, the search having occupied
eight months.
</p>

<p>
Of the two, Burton was the easier to get on
with, being full of talk and anecdotes.  Stanley
was reserved, and it often took my wife some
time to draw from him stories, full of interest,
about the King of Uganda and other persons,
and incidents of his courageous travels.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Labouchere
</span>
</p>

<p>
Our acquaintance with Henry Labouchere
dates back to the time when he built the
Queen's Theatre in Long Acre, where St. Martin's
Hall formerly stood, and of which his
wife was the manageress.  Henrietta Hodson
was a clever actress, whom, in the early days
of the old Prince of Wales's Theatre, we
introduced to London.  She afterwards played
Esther Eccles in <i>Caste</i> with the first complete
company which toured the provinces.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
</p>

<p>
Labouchere's varied career, after he left Eton
and Cambridge, began in diplomacy.  Among
many similar stories I have heard of him in
those days, is one of a pompous visitor who,
calling at the embassy in Washington, and not
liking the look of so youthful an attaché, said
abruptly: "Can I see your boss?" Labouchere
calmly replied: "With pleasure, if you'll tell
me to what part of my person you refer."
</p>

<p>
After giving up diplomacy he entered
Parliament; at one time represented
Northampton with Bradlaugh.  I think it was then
he became known as "Labby," and a sort of
licensed clown.  He was also prominently
associated with journalism.  His "Letters of
a Besieged Resident," sent over from Paris by
balloons, were so sensational as to increase the
circulation of a daily paper by more than
double.
</p>

<p>
We knew him best on the Lake of Como,
at Cadenabbia, a place he loved, which my
wife said ought really to be renamed
Cade<i>labbya</i>.  I remember his suddenly turning to
her one morning and saying that he would
rather be deformed than unnoticed.
</p>

<p>
On the night that our Haymarket career
commenced London was fog-bound.  The
density lasted for days, being unique in its
horrors, as records of the time can tell.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
Labouchere was at the theatre and emerged
with the rest of the audience into dreadful
gloom.  This is the story of his reaching home.
He ran heavily against a man, who asked him
in what direction he wanted to go.  Labouchere
replied, "Queen Anne's Gate."  The questioner
said that he also was going that way,
in fact, that he lived hard by, and would take
him there safely if he chose to go with him.
Labouchere had some fears as to being trapped,
but decided to risk it and be wary.  The two
plodded along together arm-in-arm; they met
with one or two minor difficulties; but
presently the cheerful stranger, who evidently
was of humble station, stood still in the pitch
darkness and said: "Here we are; what's
your number?"  Labouchere told him, and
his companion answered: "Then we must
cross the road."  They did so, the man groped
about a door with his fingers and said: "That's
your house; you're all right now; try your
latchkey."
</p>

<p>
Labouchere, before rewarding his friendly
guide, in amazement asked how he had found
his way so accurately on such a night.  The
simple answer was: "I'm blind!"
</p>

<p>
He ended his days at his villa in Italy.  When
I read his name in the Honours List as Privy
Councillor, I sent him a telegram:
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
"Labouchere, Florence.  Congratulations.
Bancroft."  His reply was to the effect that I had puzzled
him dreadfully, as he had no idea to what I
referred until he received <i>The Times</i> on the
following day.
</p>

<p>
Oscar Browning&mdash;or shall I say "O.B."?&mdash;was
an odd-looking creature.  We made his
acquaintance in our haunt for many years, the
Engadine, when my wife christened him "The
Wicked Monk."  For my part, I never felt
quite certain how much of him was "Jekyll"
and how little there was of "Hyde."
</p>

<p>
Some time afterwards he sent word to me at
the theatre that he was in the stalls and would
like to introduce me to a young friend who was
his companion.  I arranged that he should do
so at the end of the play, when they were
brought behind the scenes, and O.B. made me
known to Mr. George Curzon, who had recently
left Eton, and whose friendship, if I may use
the word, I claim the privilege of having since
enjoyed, in the great position to which Browning
had no doubt foreseen that his pupil would
attain.  Our last meeting was when Lord Curzon
presided at the dinner given to another old
friend of mine, T. P. O'Connor, with a charm
only equalled, in my experience, on somewhat
similar occasions by Lord Rosebery and Lord
Balfour.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Comyns Carr
</span>
</p>

<p>
I think it was when I first met Comyns
Carr&mdash;"Joe"&mdash;early in the seventies, that I heard
him rebuke a pushing young man as "a
pantaloon without his maturity and a clown
without his colour"&mdash;the sort of thing that
he fired off throughout his life, as if he were
a well-charged satirical machine-gun.
</p>

<p>
He had been called to the Bar, but was then
on the eve of his marriage with the attractive
Miss Strettell, the daughter of a delightful old
clergyman whom I knew as the chaplain at
St. Moritz.  Carr did not stick to his first
choice of a profession, which I always regarded
as a pity, but drifted into journalism instead.
He was, in his day, attached to many newspapers.
Then, fostered by his love and knowledge
of art, came a long career when Sir
Coutts Lindsay, our old friend and guest,
reigned at the Grosvenor Gallery, with Carr
as Director.  It was famous for Sunday
afternoon parties, which were unique.  The robes
of Royalty rubbed against the skirts of
Bohemia.  "Ladies and other dukes" were
plentiful, as were the followers of every art,
and all were happy.  Then he wrote plays;
next managed a theatre.
</p>

<p>
I often think he was right when he said to
me: "My dear B, the first duty of wine is to
be red."  Most of the witty things he uttered
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
have no doubt appeared in print; perhaps the
following gem has not.  An old and well-known
friend, who dyed his hair and beard so
unnatural a black that even the raven's wing
had no chance against it, was lunching, on a hot
day, in the revealing sun's rays, with some
club friends, of whom one was Comyns Carr,
and presenting a sad picture of the struggle
between the ravages of time and the appliances
of art.  He left the table early, and his departure
was followed by remarks.  "How dreadful&mdash;what
a pity!"  "Can't somebody advise
something?"  Some one turned to Carr, who
had remained silent, and asked him what he
thought.  Joe replied that of all his friends
and acquaintances the old fellow was the only
one who really was as black as he was painted.
</p>

<p>
Carr's gift of eloquence was naturally sought
at public banquets, where his speeches took
high rank.  But was it not, after all, the old
story of "a rolling stone" which left him
best remembered by his brilliant tongue?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Cecil Clay
</span>
</p>

<p>
I could go on writing of other Men of Mark
to whom I have had the good fortune to play
the host, and tell again of the great goodness
shown to followers of the stage by members of
the healing art, and by lights in the law; but
let me bring this chapter to its close by a
reference to Cecil Clay, who wrote <i>A Pantomime
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
Rehearsal</i> and, with those who acted his
amusing play, gave the old generation much
pleasure.  He was beloved in every circle that
he moved in, and I never heard an unkind
word pass his lips or saw an unkind look upon
his face.  He went so far once as to reproach
a fellow-member of one of his many clubs who
swore at the matches because they would not

The Sickles tragedy
</span>
</p>

<p>
I have alluded to an early visit to New York,
when I was a lad of seventeen.  During my
stay what was known as "The Sickles
Tragedy" occurred in Washington; the
details of which have lingered in my mind
ever since.  Many years afterwards my wife
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P146"></a>146}</span>
and I were at an evening party given by the
Dion Boucicaults to a handsome and
distinguished-looking American, with one leg
and a crutch; the other leg he had lost,
valiantly, on the field of Gettysburg.  His
name was Daniel Sickles.  My interest was at
once aroused.  He was, or had been, United
States Minister to Spain, being no less eminent
in diplomacy and the civil service than as a
volunteer soldier and general.  At one time
the tragedy of his life might have robbed his
country of his great abilities.  He had married,
some six years before, a beautiful girl of sixteen,
Italian by origin, and they were living in
Washington, where Sickles held a Government
appointment, when he learned from an
anonymous letter that his young wife was
false to him, clandestinely meeting at a
certain house hired from an old negro woman by
her lover, named Philip Barton Key, a widower
nearly twice her age, a Government lawyer, and
the son of the author of "The Star-Spangled
Banner."  Sickles had the house watched, and
found that the news was true.  Charged with
the offence, his wife confessed all, and explained
the system of signals by which, from an upper
window, she and Key, watching through an
opera-glass from his club, arranged their
meetings.  Sickles demanded her wedding-ring, told
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P147"></a>147}</span>
her to leave his house and return to her parents.
Soon afterwards, looking out of his window,
he saw the seducer walking towards the house
and make a signal with his handkerchief.  He
went out, and coming up with Key at the
street-corner, accused him to his face and shot
him.  Key attempted to defend himself, but
Sickles fired twice more, and then, while Key
was on the ground and still breathing, put
his revolver to his own head.  Twice it missed
fire.  Sickles then walked away and gave himself
up to the police.  The case aroused intense
excitement, not only in America but in
England.  The trial lasted some weeks, and so
strong was public opinion in the prisoner's
favour that he was acquitted, and set free to
do his country services in the future.  I have
been told that, in years after, husband and
wife came together again.  It is certain that
all through the affair, Sickles treated her with
the greatest consideration, even allowing her
to keep their eldest child, who, grown into a
beautiful girl, was present with her father
when we met at the Boucicaults' and who soon
afterwards was our guest.

<p>
Of the distinguished Americans who have
been sent to our country as Ambassadors from
their own land I have met Mr. Lowell, Mr. Phelps,
Mr. Bayard, Mr. Choate, Mr. Page, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
Mr. Davis.  It is a privilege to have known
such men; a greater privilege, in the case of
Mr. Choate, to have been his host.  I don't
know whether a charming little story has been
in print before&mdash;very likely it has&mdash;but I can
answer for its exactitude as I now tell it, and
where the incident occurred.
</p>

<p>
On one of his visits to us the subject was
started&mdash;I think by Bishop Boyd-Carpenter&mdash;of
changing one's identity.  My wife turned
to her chief guest and said: "Tell us, Your
Excellency, who you would rather be if you
were not Mr. Choate."  The Ambassador,
slightly rising from his chair, bowed across the
table to his wife, who was at my side, and at
once replied: "Mrs. Choate's second husband."

THE STAGE
</h3>

<p class="intro">

When I was nineteen I ran away from home
to become an actor, and have been
stage-struck ever since.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Charles Mathews
</span>
</p>

<p>
Of eminent Victorian leaders of my calling
the first to be our guest, in very far-away days,
was the accomplished Charles Mathews, the
most conspicuous comedian of his time.  The
memory of childhood's play-going days tells
me that I once saw Madame Vestris, his first
wife, a beautiful and accomplished woman, in
one of Planche's extravaganzas called <i>The
King of the Peacocks</i>, at the Lyceum Theatre.
I first met Charles Mathews in 1863, as a star
in the theatrical firmament when I was a
struggling young actor in Dublin, where I had
the great advantage of playing with him in a
round of his favourite comedies for a whole
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
month; during which I hope I learnt something
from his delightful personality of the
beautiful art of acting.
</p>

<p>
Among other accomplishments, he was an
amusing after-dinner speaker.  When presiding
at a theatrical charity banquet, with his
own charm of manner, he began: "Douglas
Jerrold once said to me that he did not despair
of living to see the day when I should be
trudging up Ludgate Hill, with an umbrella
under my arm, to invest my funds in the Bank
of England.  I am sorry to say that the great
humorist did not live to see that vision
realised.  The only step I have advanced
towards it is, that I have bought the umbrella."
</p>

<p>
When Mathews left England for a tour in
Australia, a banquet was given in his honour
at which he presided; himself proposing the
toast of his own health in these words:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"The most important task assigned to me has
now to be fulfilled, and I rise to propose what
is called the toast of the evening with a
mixture of pleasure and trepidation.  I was going
to say that I was placed in a novel but
unprecedented position, by being asked to occupy
the chair.  But it is not so.  There is nothing
new in saying that there is nothing new.  In
<i>The Times</i> of October 3rd, 1798, there is an
advertisement of a dinner given to Mr. Fox
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
on the anniversary of his first election for
Westminster: 'The Hon. Charles James Fox
in the chair.'  Here is a great precedent;
and what was done by Charles James Fox in
1798 is only imitated in 1870 by Charles James
Mathews.  I venture to assert that a fitter
man than myself to propose the health of our
guest could not be found; for I venture to
affirm that there is no man so well acquainted
with the merits and demerits of that gifted
individual as I am.  I have been on intimate
terms with him from his earliest youth.  I
have watched over his progress from childhood,
have shared in his joys and griefs, and I
assert boldly that there is not a man on earth
for whom I entertain so sincere a regard and
affection.  Nor do I go too far in stating that
he has an equal affection for me.  He has
come to me for advice in the most embarrassing
circumstances, and what is still more
remarkable, has always taken my advice in
preference to that of any one else."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Needless to say the speech was interrupted
at every point by laughter.  Here is a
characteristic letter I received from him during a
winter which he was passing at Nice:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"It is hard to be obliged to come indoors
on such a heavenly day to write a letter,
and you will no doubt think it harder to be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
obliged to read it.  But friendship calls,
and I sacrifice myself upon its altar.  Do
thou likewise.
</p>

<p>
"A very nice fellow has written a comedy.
('O Lord!' I hear you say.)  All I ask of
you is to read it, have the parts copied out
and produce it, playing the principal part
yourself&mdash;nothing more.  Your new piece, of
course, will not run more than two or three
years, and then you will have this ready to
fall back upon.  The human mind naturally
looks forward, and managers cannot make
their arrangements too soon.  If by any
unforeseen and improbable chance you may not
fancy the piece (such things have happened),
please drop me a sweet little note, so
charmingly worded that the unhappy author may
swallow the gilded pill without difficulty.
There is something in the piece&mdash;or I would
not inflict it upon you.  If well dressed, and
carefully put upon the stage, it <i>might</i> be
effective.
</p>

<p>
"This is what is called writing just <i>one line</i>.
You will of course say it 'wants cutting,'
like the piece.  So I will cut it&mdash;short.
</p>

<p>
"On reading this rigmarole, I find I have
only used the word 'piece' four times.  When
you give my letter to the copyist, you can
make the following alterations: For 'piece'
(No. 1) read 'play.'  For 'piece' (No. 2)
read 'production.' For 'piece' (No. 3)
read 'work.'  For 'piece' (No. 4) read
'comedy.'"

"Our Boys"
</span>
</p>

<p>
As an instance of his good judgment, on
the first night of Byron's comedy, <i>Our Boys</i>,
which had a phenomenal run, I was in the
billiard room of the Garrick Club; a group of
men came in who said they had been to see a
new comedy at the Vaudeville Theatre.  Various
opinions were expressed, several present
thinking the comedy would only have a
moderate run, when Mathews, who was playing
pool, said, quietly: "I don't agree with you
fellows.  I was there, and haven't laughed so
heartily for a long while.  Byron this time&mdash;he
doesn't always&mdash;has taken his goods to
exactly the right shop.  That play is sure to
run."
</p>

<p>
Charles Mathews was originally an architect
of considerable skill and promise.  Although
he did not go upon the stage until he was
thirty, he became one of the most beloved of
the public's favourites.  Mathews was
distinctly an actor of manners: it was beyond
his range to portray emotion.  Later on,
Charles Wyndham, at one time in his career,
had some of his attributes, and so, very
strongly, had Kendal.  Nowadays, the actor
who at times recalls him to me in the delicacy
and refinement of his comedy is Gerald du
Maurier.
</p>

<p>
Pictorially, Charles Mathews lives again in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
the interesting series of stage portraits on the
walls of the Garrick Club with which I was
first familiar on the staircases when he lived
in Pelham Crescent and Belgrave Road.
</p>

<p>
In a defence of himself and the view he took
of his art, he once said: "It has been urged
against me that I always play the same
characters in the same way, and that ten years
hence I should play the parts exactly as I play
them now; this I take as a great compliment.
It is a precision which has been aimed at by
the models of my profession, which I am proud
to follow, and shows, at least, that my acting,
such as it is, is the result of art, and study,
and not of mere accident."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Charles Fechter
</span>
</p>

<p>
I can also take the reader back to another
link with the past and tell him briefly something
of Charles Fechter, also of Victorian fame,
whose name opens up a mine of memories.  In
our early married days we lived in St. John's
Wood; Fechter was our neighbour and once
our guest.  I regard him as the finest actor of
the romantic drama I have ever seen.  The
eye, the voice, the grace&mdash;all so needed&mdash;were
at his command.  He was the original of the
lover in <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i>.  I was
present at his début in London, so long ago as
1860, when, as Ruy Blas, he forsook the French
for the English stage, and I saw his first
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
performance of <i>The Corsican Brothers</i>, in which
play he also acted originally in Paris.  This
was at the old Princess's Theatre in Oxford
Street, which, a decade earlier, had been the
scene of the Charles Kean Shakespearean
revivals, most of which I saw in my 'teens.
They were a great advance scenically on all that
had been done by Macready, while their
splendours and pageantry were in turn eclipsed
first by Irving and afterwards by Tree; but
genius has no part in plastering treacle on
jam.
</p>

<p>
So vivid is my remembrance of Fechter's
acting in <i>Hamlet</i>, which took the town by
storm, that I can describe and illustrate much
of it after a lapse of more than fifty years.  He
made the Prince a fair-haired, almost flaxen,
Dane.  Dickens said: "No innovation was
ever accepted with so much favour by so
many intellectuals as Fechter's Hamlet."
</p>

<p>
Quite recently I came across the impressions
of Clement Scott, for many years one of the
most prominent of our dramatic critics.  He
wrote: "Let me candidly own that I never
quite understood <i>Hamlet</i> until I saw Fechter
play the Prince of Denmark.  Phelps and
Charles Kean impressed me with the play, but
with Fechter, I loved the play, and was charmed
as well as fascinated by the player."  He
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
afterwards failed as Othello, while his
performance of Iago was a triumph.  It is a
coincidence that Fechter should have received
valuable help during his reign at the Lyceum
from Kate Terry, whose younger sister, Ellen,
in a similar position, did so much for Irving
in the same theatre later on.
</p>

<p>
Fechter died in America in 1879.  His last
years were sad.  But a decade or so before,
the idol of the playgoing public, the compeer
of all distinguished in the arts, the welcome
guest of Charles Dickens at Gad's Hill, he
died beyond the seas neglected, friendless,
almost forgotten.  Few actors at their zenith
have held greater sway; few could compare
with him in romantic parts; fewer still could
claim to have stirred two nations of playgoers
in different tongues; but such is the fleeting
nature of our work, so faint the record of it
left behind, that one might ask how many now
can speak of Fechter as he really was, how few
will even know his name?  "Out, out, brief
candle!"  His talent was not confined to
the stage, as a spirited bust of himself, his
own work, now in the Garrick Club, will show.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Salvini
</span>
</p>

<p>
Later on, there came the eminent Italian
actor, Salvini, whose visit to this country in
1875 may still be remembered by a dwindling
few.  He was the greatest tragedian I have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
seen&mdash;he was never a tenor trying to sing a
bass song.  On the stage the Italians, to my
mind, have the advantage over other actors in
being beyond question the finest pantomimists
in the world&mdash;they can say so much without
speaking.  Those two great actresses, Ristori
and Duse, made masterly use of this gift.
</p>

<p>
At an afternoon performance of <i>Othello</i> by
Salvini, specially given at Drury Lane Theatre
to the leading representatives of the English
Stage, who chiefly composed the vast
assemblage, I was present.  Salvini's superbly
delivered address to the Senate at once
convinced the remarkable audience that no
ordinary actor was before them&mdash;so calm, so
dignified, so motionless&mdash;broken only by the
portrayal of love as he caught sight of
Desdemona entering on the scene.  No ovation that
I have taken part in equalled in enthusiasm
the reception from his up-standing comrades
at the close of the third act.  His death scene
I took exception to as being too shocking, too
realistic, too like an animal dying in the
shambles or on a battle-field.  There I thought
the Italian was surpassed by the Irishman,
G. V. Brooke, the only actor I have seen who
shared Salvini's natural gifts of voice and
bearing, and who, but for his unfortunate
intemperate habits, might have achieved lasting
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
fame upon the stage.  His death in <i>Othello</i>
seemed to me as poetic in conception as it
was pathetic in execution.  Acting, although
not speaking, the closing words, "Killing
myself, to die upon a kiss," he staggered
towards the bed, dying as he clutched the
heavy curtains of it, which, giving way, fell
upon his prostrate body as a kind of pall,
disclosing, at the same time, the dead form of
Desdemona.  I agree with the great Frenchman
who said: "Even when it assassinates,
even when it strangles, tragedy remembers
that it wears the crown and carries a sceptre."
</p>

<p>
In a little letter to my wife, Salvini wrote:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"CHÈRE MADAME,&mdash;Que vous êtes aimable!
Je tiendrai votre joli cadeau comme un doux
souvenir de votre sincère amitié.  Ce sera un
précieux talisman qui suivra le reste de ma
carrière artistique, et qui, je suis sûr,
m'apportera du bonheur."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The perfect Hamlet
</span>
</p>

<p>
In a conversation I had with Salvini, he
modestly said his nationality and Southern
blood made it comparatively easy for him to
play the jealous Moor, while they stood in his
way when he attempted the part of the
Northern moody Dane, to which his robust
physique was not suited.  Salvini's
performance, however, of <i>Hamlet</i> has left me
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
memories almost as keen as those bequeathed
by Fechter.  In his arrangement of the play
he acted the long speech of his father's ghost.
You only heard, and hardly saw the Phantom.
His scene with his mother was very fine: his
management of the foils in the fight with
Laertes as superb as it was original: his
death the most touching I can recall: it was
the "Kiss me, Hardy" of Nelson; he felt for
Horatio's head and drew it down to his face
as the spirit fled.  To make a perfect Hamlet
I should weld together ever to be remembered
portions from the performances of Fechter,
Salvini, Irving and Forbes-Robertson.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to read what Macready, the
greatest of the Victorian classic actors, said of
this complex, fascinating character:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"It seems to me as if only now at fifty-one
years of age, I thoroughly see and appreciate
the artistic power of Shakespeare in this great
human phenomenon: nor do any of the
critics, Goethe, Schlegel, or Coleridge, present
to me, in their elaborate remarks, the exquisite
artistical effects which I see in this work, as
long meditation, like long straining after light,
gives the minutest portion of its excellence to
my view."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
From my childhood I have always looked
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
upon Macready as the head of my craft, and
regarded him with the reverence a young curate
would feel, I suppose, towards the Archbishop
of Canterbury.
</p>

<p>
I regret that I never saw Macready act.  I
was not ten years old when he left the stage.
I had the pleasure, long afterwards, to know
his son, Jonathan, a clever surgeon, whose son,
Major Macready, I now know; and I rejoice in
the friendship of the tragedian's youngest
child, General Sir Nevil Macready, whom I
first saw at his father's funeral, when he was
lifted from a mourning coach&mdash;a little fellow
of about ten.
</p>

<p>
My wife was the last stage link with
Macready.  At one of the farewell performances
he gave when he retired she appeared as the
child apparition in <i>Macbeth</i>.
</p>

<p>
I am wandering from my departed guests,
but may mention that in my boyhood I saw
much of that fine actor, Samuel Phelps, who
had so wide a range and to whom no character
seemed to come amiss.  I have always felt,
however, that he was a disciple of Macready, to
whom undoubtedly he owed much, and whom
he followed as Richelieu, Werner and Virginius.
</p>

<p>
I may just say that, in my early career, I have
acted with Phelps, as well as with Charles
Kean and G. V. Brooke, and it may surprise
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
young actors of to-day to know that, in my
provincial novitiate of four years and three
months, I played no fewer than three hundred
and forty-six different parts, with the
advantage of repeating many of the Shakespearean
characters with different leading actors.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A tribute from Got
</span>
</p>

<p>
I met and knew the great French comedian
Edmond Got, for many years doyen of the
<i>Comédie française</i>, in the far-off days of the
Commune.  The chief members of the troupe
were here in exile for many months, when it
was a privilege to entertain them.  It was
strange to learn that Got had served in the
French cavalry before he went upon the stage.
I append a gracious letter I received from him:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Je veux vous remercier de la gracieuse
hospitalité que vous avez bien voulu nous
offrir, et vous prier de mettre aux pieds de
Mme. Bancroft l'hommage de mon respect et de
ma très sincère admiration.
</p>

<p>
"Quant à vous, monsieur, vous avez montré
ce que peut obtenir de ses artistes un habile
administrateur, doublé d'un parfait comédien,
c'est-à-dire un ensemble que je souhaiterais
rencontrer sur beaucoup de scènes parisiennes,
et quelquefois sur la nôtre."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Two often welcomed guests were the brothers
Coquelin, <i>ainé</i> and <i>cadet</i>.  The elder was a
great actor, the younger a good actor and a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
brilliant <i>diseur</i>.  Coquelin, as well as his
distinguished comrade, Mounet-Sully, also his
eminent compatriot, Clemenceau, belonged to
"The Vintage."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Coquelin
</span>
</p>

<p>
My friendship for Coquelin was one of many
years.  No stage-struck youth perhaps was
more unlikely to succeed; but his teacher at
the Conservatoire&mdash;the great Regnier&mdash;always
argued that to make a really fine actor a man
should have to fight against some physical
drawback.
</p>

<p>
Coquelin was the most outspoken admirer of
my wife's acting.  He said: "her splendid
vitality was contagious: her winning
magnetism would fill the largest stage."  If my
saying so does not detract from this praise, I
may add that he showered encomiums in a
Parisian journal on my performance in <i>The
Dead Heart</i>, when I acted with Irving.  He
once wrote to me:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"CHER BANCROFT,&mdash;Vous avez un excellent
théâtre que vous dirigez en maître&mdash;et en
maître artiste&mdash;que pouvez-vous désirer de
plus?  Ah, cette fois-ci, Bravo, et sans
restriction.  Cet orchestre qu'on ne voit pas,
cette rampe presque imperceptible, cette absence
du manteau d'Arlequin, ce cadre contournant
la scène!  Le spectateur est devant un tableau
dont les personnages parlent et agissent.  C'est
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
parfait pour l'illusion et pour le plaisir artistique.
Votre ami,&mdash;C. COQUELIN."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I have a valued souvenir of him in his
autographed portrait as Cyrano.
</p>

<p>
In his home his gaiety was delightful, while
his love for his simple old mother was enshrined
in his heart as it would seem always to be in
that of a good Frenchman.
</p>

<p>
The farewell words of Jules Claretie, the
accomplished director of the <i>Théâtre français</i>,
spoken by his grave, were indeed a tribute:
"Coquelin was more than a stage king, he
was a king of the stage, and has left a luminous
trail in the heaven of art."
</p>

<p>
I was one of the group of English actors
who went to Paris with our sculptured offering
to his genius which is enshrined in the historic
foyer, where, at a luncheon, I had the temerity
to make a short speech in indifferent French,
urged to do so by Madame Bartet, a brilliant
actress, who helped me to frame some of its
sentences.
</p>

<p>
And his poor brother.  It is painful to think
of <i>cadet's</i> bright nature being quenched by
incurable melancholia: distressing indeed to
imagine what his sufferings must have been
before the evening when, in the middle of the
play, he rushed through the stage door, clad
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
as an abbé, to be seen no more at his beloved
<i>Comédie française</i>.  In an amusing account
published in a leading Paris paper of a visit to
see Robertson's comedy, <i>School</i>, he wrote:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Les décors sont executés de main de
maître.  C'est le triomphe de l'exactitude.
Les comédiens sont excellents.  M. Bancroft
joue dans la pièce un rôle de grand gommeux
à monocle, et rien n'égale son élégance et sa
stupidité.  Madame Bancroft joue la
pensionnaire gaie: cette petite femme est un
mélange d'Alphonsine et de Chaumont&mdash;gaie,
pimpante, mordante et d'une adresse! ... C'est
la <i>great attraction</i> du Théâtre de Haymarket.
</p>

<p>
"Après je reviens rapidement en cab
("hansom") à mon hôtel, et je me demande
en chemin pourquoi les cabs vont si vite?
C'est tout simple; les cabs vont très vite parce
que les cochers les poussent derrière."

No less an authority than David Garrick
once said to an ambitious stage aspirant who
sought his advice, that he might humbug the
public in tragedy, but warned him not to try
to do so in comedy, for that was a serious thing.
This opinion was borne out by Voltaire, who,
in his anxiety not to imperil the success he had
achieved in tragedy, when he wrote his first
comedy did so anonymously.

Joseph Jefferson
</span>
</p>

<p>
Having pleasant memories of two distinguished
American actors&mdash;one a comedian,
the other a tragedian&mdash;I will follow the high
opinion held by the great Englishman of
Thalia's children, and write first of Joseph
Jefferson, incomparably the finest actor who has
come to us from America, and who in his day
made a powerful impression and won enduring
fame by his performance of <i>Rip Van Winkle</i>
and his new rendering of Bob Acres in <i>The
Rivals</i>, which he admitted was not free from
liberties with Sheridan.  I can think of no
actor who has been more beloved by audiences
in his native land.  I must, of course, use that
expression, although his grandfather, or perhaps
great-grandfather, was British, and an actor
under David Garrick.  He was, as it were,
cradled on the stage.
</p>

<p>
Jefferson might also have made fame and
money by his brush.  His work was worthily
hung upon the walls of the Royal Academy.
I cherish two of his paintings: one, a gift to
my wife in remembrance of a happy day we all
spent together on the Thames, a charming
example of one of its many backwaters near
Cookham; the other&mdash;a purchase&mdash;of
Shakespeare's church at Stratford-on-Avon&mdash;both
reminiscent of Corot.  The former always
suggests to me the misty Hebrides and an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
appropriate background for the "Island that
liked to be visited," in Barrie's <i>Mary Rose</i>.
</p>

<p>
Gazing, I remember, at the old Maidenhead
bridge at sunset, Jefferson murmured: "What
a lovely place is this England of yours!  How
I should just like to lift it in my arms and
carry it right away."
</p>

<p>
When Edwin Booth, the American tragedian,
came over to play in London, Millais gave him
a dinner, and invited the leading players of the
day to make his acquaintance.  He was a fine
actor; especially so, I thought, in <i>The Fool's
Revenge</i> and <i>Richelieu</i>.  When he drew the
"awful circle" round the shrinking form of the
young heroine and said to the villain of the
play: "Set but a foot within that holy
ground and on thy head&mdash;yea, though it wore
a crown&mdash;I launch the curse of Rome!" you
felt you were in the presence of high dramatic
art.  The performance at the Lyceum Theatre,
in which he and Irving alternated the parts of
<i>Othello</i> and <i>Iago</i>, created great interest.  Booth
was the better Othello; Irving the more
attractive and less conventional Iago.
</p>

<p>
Booth would now and then dine with us on
a Sunday evening&mdash;to help him bear a sorrow
which is, at such times, the actor's lot, and
which an extract from a letter to a close
friend will best explain:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
</p>

<p>
"I am tired in body and brain.  The poor
girl is passing away from us.  For weeks she
has been failing rapidly; and the doctors
tell me that she is dying.  You can imagine
my condition: acting at random every evening,
and nursing a half-insane, dying wife all day,
and all night too, for that matter.  I am scarce
sane myself.  I scribble this in haste at two
in the morning, for I know not when I will have
a chance to write sensibly again."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The room in which Edwin Booth died&mdash;which
I have visited&mdash;at the Players' Club in
Grammercy Park, New York, founded by
himself, and where he had been so beloved, was
left untouched after he had passed away, and,
I understand, so remains.
</p>

<p>
When I was a lad of seventeen I went for
a trip to New York, and during my stay I
chanced to see Edward Askew Sothern&mdash;to
give him his full name&mdash;play his world-renowned
character, <i>Lord Dundreary</i>, for the
first time in his life.  Some years later, when we
met upon the stage, I gave him my copy of
the original playbill, which, of course, had great
interest for him.  The eccentric nobleman drew
all playgoers for years in England as well as
in America.  At the time I mention I saw
Sothern and Jefferson act together in a round
of old English comedies.  As young men they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
made giant successes in individual
parts&mdash;<i>Dundreary</i> and <i>Rip Van Winkle</i>&mdash;the one
a masterpiece of caricature, the other a
veritable old Dutch master.
</p>

<p>
Another of Sothern's chief parts, in those
days, was <i>David Garrick</i>, of which he was the
original representative, long before the play
was taken over and prominently associated
with the career of Charles Wyndham.
</p>

<p>
Sothern was always kind to me, whether in
my early days in the provinces or afterwards
in town.  He was my guest at the first
dinner-party I had the courage to give.  Among those
who sat with him were Dion Boucicault,
W. S. Gilbert, W. R. McConnell and Tom Hood.  I
was a young host, not having struck twenty-six.
He was a fearless rider and hunting man.
Once, after he had met with a bad accident,
following the staghounds, I went to see him at
his charming old house, called The Cedars, in
Kensington, and found his bed placed in the
middle of the room.  The house, when I last
saw it, had become a home for cripples.
</p>

<p>
Sothern was the king of practical-jokers and
would stop at nothing in the way of thought,
time or money, to carry out his wild projects.
A poor game at its best, I have often thought
in mature age; a selfish form of innings.
</p>

<p>
He was an intense admirer of my wife's art.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
Only after he had passed away did it come to
my knowledge that in some stage experiences,
published in America, with the title <i>Birds of
a Feather</i>, he gave his judgment of her.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Among the actresses I should certainly
place Mrs. Bancroft and Mrs. Kendal in the
foremost rank, their specialities being high
comedy.  Mrs. Bancroft I consider the best
actress on the English stage; in fact, I might
say on any stage."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Sam Sothern, so long a pleasant actor on
our stage, is dead, so his father's name and
fame are now successfully held by his son,
Edward, in America.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Dion Boucicault
</span>
</p>

<p>
One of the most remarkable of Victorians in
stage-land was Dion Boucicault, father of
my life-long little friend, "Dot," the
accomplished husband of Irene Vanbrugh.
Boucicault produced his first comedy, <i>London
Assurance</i>&mdash;a brilliant one in its day&mdash;about the
date of my birth, when he himself was not more
than twenty-one.  He was a colossal worker
as author, actor, and producer until 1890; a
career as distinguished as it was lengthy.  His
delightful Irish plays, <i>The Colleen Bawn</i>,
<i>Arrah-na-Pogue</i> and <i>The Shaughraun</i>, were among
the joys of my youth.  I first met Boucicault
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
at Birmingham, where I was specially engaged
to act his own part, the counsel for the defence
in his drama <i>The Trial of Effie Deans</i>.  I
learnt much from him at the one rehearsal
he travelled from London to attend.  When
about half way through the trial scene he took
me aside and told me I was wrong in my
treatment of the part, adding: "Let me rehearse
the rest of the scene for you, and I am sure
you will grasp my own idea of it directly."  I
saw at once how right he was, how wrong I
had been.  The result was a considerable
success for me.  In the early days of our
managerial career we produced a comedy of his,
<i>How She Loves Him</i>&mdash;clever, but not one of the
best.  A situation at the end of an act became
very muddled, after being tried at rehearsal
in several ways.  An idea struck me, which
was a distinct improvement, but I hardly
dared to interfere with so great an autocrat,
kind as he had always been.  At last, in
despair, I suggested to Boucicault that his
original ending of the act was more effective
than that he had changed it to.  He said:
"What was that?"  I then boldly explained
my own idea as if it were his.  No doubt he
saw through the strategy, but merely said:
"Perhaps you're right," and rewarded my
shrewdness by adopting the suggestion.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
</p>

<p>
When, years afterwards, I asked his consent
to my making some alterations in <i>London
Assurance</i> and combining the fourth and fifth
acts, he replied from Chicago: "Your shape of
<i>London Assurance</i> will be, like all you have
done, unexceptionable, and I wish I could be
there to taste your brew."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Rest and rust
</span>
</p>

<p>
Later on, when my wife was taking only a
small part in some of our plays, he wrote:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"MY DEAR FRIEND,&mdash;Will you feel offended
with an old soldier if he intrudes on your
plan of battle by a remark?
</p>

<p>
"Why are the Bancrofts taking a back
seat in their own theatre; they efface
themselves!  Who made the establishment? with
whom is it wholly identified? of what materials
is it built?  There&mdash;it's out!
</p>

<p>
"Tell Marie, with my love, that there is
nothing so destructive as <i>rest</i> if persisted in;
you must alter the vowel&mdash;it becomes <i>rust</i>,
and eats into life.  Hers is too precious to let
her fool it away; she is looking splendid,
and as fresh as a pat of butter.  Why don't
you get up a version of <i>The Country Girl</i>?
Let her play Hoyden and you play Lord
Foppington."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Boucicault was a perfect host, a brilliant
talker and sympathetic listener.  I first dined
with him, when a young man, in the delightful
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P172"></a>172}</span>
company, I remember well, of Charles Reade,
J. M. Bellew and Edmund Yates.  On the
menu was printed: "The wine will be tabled.
Every man his own butler.  Smiles and
self-help."  And there was cognac of 1803 from the
cellars of Napoleon III.  I had many years of
unbroken friendship with Boucicault.  His final
words to me were in a letter from America,
following on an illness:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I doubt whether I shall cross the ocean
again.  I am rusticating at Washington, having
recovered some strength, and am waiting to
know if my lease of life is out, or is to be
renewed for another term.  I have had notice
to quit, but am arguing the point ('just like
you,' I think I hear you say), and nothing yet
is settled between Nature and me."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He was a hard worker, and said his epitaph
should be: "Dion Boucicault; his first holiday."
</p>

<p>
Where shall my pen wander next?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Montague and Coghlan
</span>
</p>

<p>
I can revive memories in the old&mdash;and tell
a little to the young&mdash;of actors who became
prominent as members of our companies at
different times.  Let me try to do so.  First,
there was Harry Montague.  Without being
an actor of high rank, he had a great value as a
<i>jeune premier</i>.  He was what I heard an American
describe as "so easy to look at."  His charm
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
of manner made him a special favourite
everywhere, and he was the original matinee idol.
When in his company he had the gift of making
you believe that he had thought but of you
since your last parting, and, when he said
"good-bye," that you would remain in his
memory until you met again.
</p>

<p>
He was in America, acting in <i>Diplomacy</i>,
when he died suddenly; as young in years as
he always seemed in heart; for he was but
midway between thirty and forty, that age
upon the border-land when one has to own
to being no more young, while resenting for
a little while that ambiguous epithet, "middle-aged."
</p>

<p>
Charles Coghlan was an actor of a higher
grade; gifted, cultivated and able: his acting
as Alfred Evelyn and Charles Surface in our
elaborate revivals of <i>Money</i> and <i>The School for
Scandal</i> was of the highest character.  It
may be interesting to note that when he first
joined our company his salary was £9 a week;
during his last engagement we paid him £60,
which would be doubled now.  I asked him once
to accompany me on a short holiday abroad,
and found him a delightful companion.  This
was soon after the siege of Paris, when many of
the terrible stains left on the fair city's face
were sadly visible.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
</p>

<p>
Coghlan often lived outside London, at
places like Elstree and Kingsbury, generally
in picturesque old houses.  My wife and I rode
out to one of them to luncheon.  For a time he
drove a rather ramshackle four-in-hand, and,
naturally, was in constant financial trouble.  He
ended his career rather recklessly in America,
at Galveston, and his body was washed out
to sea from the catacombs by a flood.  It
was afterwards recovered and reburied.
</p>

<p>
The father of the happily present Dion and
Donald Calthrop, a connection of Lord Alverstone,
John Clayton (Calthrop) was also a fine
actor.  His performance in <i>All for Her</i> was of
a high order, and he did some admirable work
with Irving at the Lyceum.  I also recall a
remarkable piece of acting on his part in a play,
adapted from the French, in which he appeared
as a father whose brain was turned by his
having accidentally shot his little son.  Under
our flag, he only acted in <i>Diplomacy</i> and <i>Caste</i>.
He was then growing fat, and never knew of a
strong wish I had to revive the <i>Merry Wives of
Windsor</i>, with himself as Falstaff.  He was
otherwise engaged, unfortunately.  This was
when that brilliant actress Mrs. John Wood
was with us, to play with my wife the two
Merry Wives, supported by myself as the
jealous Mr. Ford&mdash;I always found the portrayal
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
of jealousy very amusing&mdash;and a troupe of
able and suitable comedians.
</p>

<p>
Clayton gave remarkable performances in
the joyous comedies by Pinero at the Court
Theatre.  He died young.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Arthur Cecil
</span>
</p>

<p>
Arthur Cecil comes next to my mind: an
amiable gentleman and companion.  It was
I who, when he was "wobbling," as he did
on every subject, induced him to go on the
professional stage.  He seemed to me to pass
a large slice of his life in the effort&mdash;or want of
effort&mdash;to make up his mind on trivial things,
and so wasted at least one half of it.
</p>

<p>
At the dress rehearsal of <i>Diplomacy</i>&mdash;in
which he gave a fine performance of Baron
Stein&mdash;he appeared with a totally different
make-up in each act.  They were all clever and
appropriate, but we, not he, had to decide for
him which was to be finally adopted.  He was
very devoted to what Sir James Barrie christened
"Little Mary."  On one occasion, after
dining at the Garrick Club, before his evening's
work, having finished his meal with a double
helping of orange tart, he was leaving the
coffee-room, when he saw a friend seated near the door
just beginning his dinner.  Cecil sat down
opposite to him for a few minutes to exchange
greetings; he became so restless and agitated at
the sight of a dish of stewed eels that at last he dug
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
a fork into a mouthful, saying, "I must," and
so wound up his meal.  There are several similar
stories extant, equally amazing, equally true.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Henry Kemble
</span>
</p>

<p>
Our old and staunch friend, Henry Kemble,
a descendant of the illustrious stage family
whose name he bore, was for years a valued
member of our company; a capable but
restricted actor, from his peculiarity of diction.
My wife christened him "The Beetle," owing
to a large brown Inverness cape he wore at
night.  Many are the amusing stories told of
him.  He fought the income tax strenuously,
and on one occasion, being brought to bay,
told the collector that he belonged to a
precarious profession, and begged that Her
Majesty might be asked not to look upon him
as a source of income!
</p>

<p>
Kemble was well up in Shakespeare, and had
a greater knowledge of the Bible than any
actor I have known, except one.
</p>

<p>
This reminds me of a visit paid, at his
instigation, on a New Year's Eve, in the
company of his close friend, Arthur Cecil, to a
midnight service held in one of the big churches.
They entered reverently, just before the hour,
and were about to kneel, when a verger touched
Kemble on the shoulder and said: "I beg
your pardon, gentlemen, but this is a service
being held for fallen women."
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
</p>

<p>
Kemble suddenly made up his mind to retire
from the stage and end his days in Jersey, not
in a cloistered cathedral city, as he said would
be the case.  He, unfortunately, invested his
savings in an annuity, as he only lived a few
months after doing so.  He came to see my
wife, to whom he was much attached, to say
good-bye, and brought her some fine Waterford
glass as a farewell gift.  When fatally ill, his
last words were written to her on a telegraph
form: "All over, dear, dear Lady B.  Blessings
on you all.  Beetle."  The doctor who attended
him transcribed the words, and sent my wife
the tremblingly-written farewell he had penned
himself&mdash;a touching and kind act.
</p>

<p>
Another friend and comrade of those days
was the humorous Charles Brookfield, son of
Canon Brookfield, a distinguished preacher.
My wife and I gave the young undergraduate
what was practically his first engagement,
and he remained a popular member of our
company during the whole of our career at
the Haymarket.  Several of his performances
showed marked ability, notably in Sardou's
play, <i>Odette</i>, and Pinero's comedy, <i>Lords and
Commons</i>.  Many amusing stories are attributed
to him.  Against the accuracy of one of
them I must rebel.  It ran in this way: That at
a time when Charles Wyndham was appearing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P178"></a>178}</span>
in his favourite part of David Garrick, for a
run, he was sitting in the club named after the
great actor, just under one of his several
portraits there, when Brookfield went up to
Wyndham and said: "It really seems quite
surprising, you grow more like Garrick every
day."  Wyndham gave a delighted smile;
when Brookfield continued, in his peculiar
cynical way: "Yes, every day, but less like
him every night."  A good story; but,
unfortunately, Brookfield was never a member
of the Garrick Club.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Charles Brookfield
</span>
</p>

<p>
I think it was Brookfield who, when a friend
asked his advice, saying that a member of a
club they frequented having called him a
"mangy ass," whether he should appeal to
the committee or consult a solicitor, quietly
told him he thought it a case for a vet to
decide.
</p>

<p>
He wrote various amusing comedies, and,
later on, was appointed by the Lord
Chamberlain to be joint examiner of plays.
</p>

<p>
Brookfield had his serious side, and wrote
us the following letter, affectionately signed,
when we retired from management:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"The sadness I feel at the prospect of never
again working under your management is far
too genuine for me to endeavour to convey it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
by any conventional expressions of regret.
Although I have always appreciated your
unvarying goodness to me, it is only by the
depression of spirits and general apathy which
I now experience, that I recognise how much
my enjoyment of my profession was affected
by the kind auspices under which I had the
good fortune to practise it."

<span class="sidenote">
Henry Irving
</span>
</p>

<p>
I will now write of the man who was for many
years the chief of the English stage, Henry
Irving.  He was a born leader and had the
magnetism which compels the affection of his
comrades; he knew that to be well served
meant first to be well beloved.  Although
denied the advantages of early education,
Irving had the learning which colleges may
fail to teach; and in his later years would have
graced, in manner and in aspect, any position
in life.  This personal attribute came to him
gradually, when, as it were, he had recreated
himself.  Truth to tell, in the early part of
his career he had none of it.  In those distant
days there was a strong smack of the country
actor in his appearance, and a suggestion of a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P181"></a>181}</span>
type immortalised by Dickens in Mr. Lenville
and Mr. Folair.
</p>

<p>
We soon became friends and remained so
throughout his remarkable career&mdash;the most
remarkable in many respects that ever befell
an actor.  He told me an interesting incident
of his early life.  He was engaged, in the
summer of 1867, to act in Paris.  The enterprise
proved a failure.  The little troupe of players
was disbanded and returned to London, with
the exception of Irving, who, finding himself
abroad for the first time, lingered in the bright
city for a couple of months.  He lived in a
garret on a few francs a day, and paid nightly
visits to the cheap parts of the theatre.
Although he had no knowledge of the language,
he was all the while studying the art of acting
in its different grades and kinds.
</p>

<p>
When, in later years, he entertained in his
princely fashion eminent foreign artists, in
answer to compliments showered upon him in
French, he would, without the slightest
affectation&mdash;a failing from which he was free&mdash;answer
simply: "I am sure all you are saying is very
kind, but I don't understand a word of it."
</p>

<p>
Soon after his success as Digby Grant in
James Albery's comedy, <i>Two Roses</i>, shortly
before what proved to be the turning-point
in his career&mdash;his becoming a member of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
Lyceum company, then under the Bateman
management&mdash;I had occasion to see a well-known
dramatic agent, who, as I was leaving
his office, said: "Oh, by the way, would Henry
Irving be of use to you next season?  I have
reason to believe he would welcome such a
change."  The question was startling.  I replied
that I should be delighted, but feared it would
be difficult, as Hare, Coghlan and myself
would be in his way.  How possible it is
that a different answer might have influenced
future events in theatre-land!  Then came his
memorable performance in <i>The Bells</i>, which
gave him fame in a single night, followed by
other early triumphs, <i>Charles the First</i> and
<i>Hamlet</i>.

<p>
I once saw Irving on horseback, cantering
in the Row on a Sunday afternoon: it was a
singular experience.  His companion was
George Critchett, who gave up his practice
one day in the week to hunt instead, and
who was as much at home on a horse as Irving
was plainly uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
Later on, Irving was speaking to me of the
success of one of our plays.  I answered that in
my belief the same could be achieved at the
Lyceum (the theatre was not yet under his
own management), if money were freely and
wisely spent.  But wide is the difference
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
between spending and wasting.  While the disasters
which darkened his brilliant reign were
sometimes, it must be conceded, the result of errors
of judgment in the choice of plays, had he
been in partnership with a capable comrade,
to whose guidance he would sometimes have
submitted, he might have realised a fortune,
instead of allowing several to pass like water
through his hands.  As an artistic asset, Irving
was often wasted and thrown away.
</p>

<p>
Let me turn for a moment from the stage
side of this extraordinary man.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A toy theatre
</span>
</p>

<p>
In the gloaming of a Christmas Day, full
forty years ago, my wife and I were sitting
alone, when, to our amazement, Irving was
announced.  It was a bolt from the blue.
After a pleasant talk, we asked him who was
to have the pleasure of giving him his pudding
and mince-pie.  He answered that he should
be all alone in Grafton Street with his dog.
We told him that ourselves and our son George,
then a small boy, comprised our party, and
begged him to join us.  Irving gladly said he
would.  At the time he was acting in <i>The
Corsican Brothers</i>, of which famous melodrama
Master George had his own version in his little
model theatre, with an elaborate scene of the
duel in the snow, represented by masses of
salt smuggled from the kitchen; and this,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
with managerial pride, he told Irving he would
act before him after dinner.  To an audience
of three the performance was solemnly gone
through, being subjected to the criticisms,
seriously pronounced and respectfully received,
of the great man.  I seem to hear his voice
crying out: "Light not strong enough on the
prompt side, my boy."  For years a broken
blade of one of the rapiers used in the duel at
the Lyceum, given to him by Irving, was
among the boy's proud possessions.  I daresay
he has it still.  A memorable Christmas
evening!
</p>

<p>
The idea occurred to me to give a supper to
Irving before his first visit to America in 1883,
and to let it have a distinctive character by
inviting none but actors.  Feeling that nowhere
could be it so appropriately given as in the
Garrick Club, I wrote to my fellow-members of
the Committee to ask if, in the special
circumstances, it might take place in the dining-room.
Greatly to my delight, my request was granted,
with the remark, that it was "an honour to
the Club."  The attractive room, so suitable
for the purpose, its walls being lined with
the portraits of those whose names recall all
that is famous in the great past of our stage,
was arranged to accommodate a party of a
hundred, of whom there are but very few
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
survivors.  A humorous drawing of a supposed
wind-up to the supper&mdash;Irving, Toole and
myself staggering home, arm-in-arm&mdash;was
among the early successes of Phil May.  He
made two copies of it.  One of the three
belonged to King Edward, which I afterwards
saw at Sandringham, the others are owned by
Pinero and myself.
</p>

<p>
In acknowledgment of a little present I sent
Irving at this time he wrote:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I shall wear your gift&mdash;and a rare one it
is&mdash;as I wear you, the giver, in my heart.  My
regard for you is not a fading one.  In this
world there is not too much fair friendship,
is there?  And I hope it is a gratification to
you&mdash;it is to me, old friend&mdash;to know that we
can count alike upon a friend in sorrow and
in gladness."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
"The Dead Heart"
</span>
</p>

<p>
When Irving contemplated a production of
<i>The Dead Heart</i>, he flattered me by saying
that unless I appeared with him as the Abbé
Latour he would not carry out the idea.  I
was then free from management, and tried
to persuade him to let me undertake the part
as a labour of love, but he would not listen.
After a long talk&mdash;neither of us, I remember it
all so well, looking at the other, but each gazing
separately at different angles into Bond Street
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
from the windows of the rooms he so long
occupied at the corner of Grafton Street&mdash;he
said that I must content him by being specially
engaged, on terms which soon were settled.
</p>

<p>
It was a strange experience to re-enter a
theatre to serve instead of to govern; and in
one where the policy was so different.  My
wife and I had so often been content to choose
plays without regard to ourselves: the policy
of the Lyceum was upon another plane.  <i>The
Dead Heart</i> is a story of the French Revolution,
on the lines of <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>.  The best
scene in the play was between Irving and
myself, in which we fought a duel to the death.
A clever drawing of the scene&mdash;I regret failing
to secure it when it was sold at Christie's&mdash;was
made by Bernard Partridge.  From all I
have heard said of it, the fight must have been
well done&mdash;real, brief, and determined.  It
was a grim business, in the sombre moonlit
room, and forcibly gave the impression that
one of the two combatants would not leave it
alive.  I confess that I had not the courage of
Terriss, who found himself in a similar position
with Irving when they fought a duel in <i>The
Corsican Brothers</i>, and boldly attacked his
chief by suggesting that a little of the limelight
might fall on his side of the stage, as Nature
was impartial.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A tribute from Irving
</span>
</p>

<p>
One night during the hundred and sixty on
which <i>The Dead Heart</i> was acted, when we had
acknowledged the applause which followed the
duel, Irving put his arm round me as we
walked up the stage together, and said:
"What a big name you might have made for
yourself had you never come across those
Robertson plays!  What a pity, for your
own sake; for no actor can be remembered
long who does not appear in the classical
drama."
</p>

<p>
I fear egotism is getting the better of me.
Irving once said:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"One point must strike all in connection
with Bancroft's career&mdash;before he left the
Haymarket, at the age of forty-four, he was
the senior theatrical manager of London.  In
conjunction with that gifted lady who was the
genius of English comedy, he popularised a
system of management which has dominated our
stage ever since, and the principle of which
may be described as the harmony of realism
and art."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It is to be much regretted that no really
satisfactory portrait of Irving exists.  The one
painted by Millais, and given by him to the
Garrick Club in 1884, is a beautiful work of art,
but, to my mind, somewhat effeminate in its
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
beauty.  A portrait by Sargent, painted when
Irving was fifty, and exhibited at the Royal
Academy in 1888, was amazingly clever, but
a somewhat painful likeness.  The great painter
showed something in the great actor&mdash;as he
so often does in his sitters&mdash;which his gifted
and searching eyes could not help seeing, and
which, once having been shown, you cannot
afterwards help seeing always.  Irving hated
the portrait, and when it was taken from the
walls of the Academy it was never seen again.
I heard Irving, at my table, tell Sir Edward
Poynter that he hid it away in a garret, and
when he left the old Grafton Street chambers,
his solitary home for many years, he hacked
the canvas to shreds with a knife.  What a
treasure lost!
</p>

<p>
Irving's hospitality was unbounded.  At one
of his many parties I recollect his saying to
Frank Lockwood, when he was Solicitor-General:
"The fortunate actor is the actor
who works hard."  He then pointed across the
table to me, and added: "Look at that fellow,
and remember what hard work meant in his
case.  'B' is the only actor since Garrick who
made a fortune purely by management of his
own theatre&mdash;I mean without the aid of
provincial tours and visits to America."  After
a pause he continued: "But he has paid the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
penalty of leaving his best work as an actor
undone."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Knighthood
</span>
</p>

<p>
It will ever be remembered that Henry
Irving was the first actor to receive from his
Sovereign the honour of State recognition: so
placing his calling on a level with the rest, no
more to be looked at askance, but recognised as
leading to a share of the distinctions enjoyed
by his fellow-men.
</p>

<p>
For a year or more before the end it was
manifest to those who loved him that the sword
had worn out the scabbard&mdash;it hung so listlessly
by his side.  This I strongly realised the last
time he sat at our table, and was struck by his
plaintive manner to my wife and to me.  He
then had a flat in Stratton Street, and left us at
midnight, saying that he must be home before
the lift ceased running or he would have to be
carried upstairs.
</p>

<p>
In affectionate remembrance I close my
tribute to Henry Irving.  His remarkable
career has taken its place in the history of his
country, for he was one of the leaders of men
who earned the privilege, given to but few,
to become the property of the world.
</p>

<p>
It may also be truly said of Irving, as of one
of the most distinguished of his predecessors:
"He who has done a single thing that others
never forget, and feel ennobled whenever they
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
think of, need not regret his having been, and
may throw aside this fleshly coil like any other
worn-out part, grateful and contented."
</p>

<p>
Although I knew and loved them from their
boyhood, I find it difficult to write of Irving's
sons, being, as they were, so overpowered by
the dominant personality of the father.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
"H.B." and Laurence
</span>
</p>

<p>
They both went to Marlborough.  "H.B."
afterwards to New College, Oxford.  Laurence
left school for Paris, to perfect his knowledge
of French, his ambition and inclination being
the diplomatic service.  He then passed some
three years in Russia, acquiring mastery of the
difficult language.  Unhappily, his wished-for
career had to be abandoned for want of the
imperative funds.  "H.B." was called to the
Bar, but lacked the necessary patience, and so
abandoned a profession, as was thought by
many competent judges, in which he was
eminently qualified to take a high position;
while his "hobby" until the end was criminology,
and he wrote remarkable books on that
fascinating subject.
</p>

<p>
Both sons drifted on to the stage.  Before
that step was taken I had seen "H.B." at
Oxford give a striking performance, for one
so young, of <i>King John</i>.
</p>

<p>
Later on, I had no wish to see him act a long
round of his father's old parts.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
</p>

<p>
Towards the end of the War he left his work
at the Savoy Theatre and devoted himself to
hard work in the Intelligence Department at
the Admiralty, which proved to be a great
strain upon him.  We met frequently at that
time, by appointment, at the Athenæum, hard
by, and had luncheon together, as he did with
his close friend, E. V. Lucas.  It was manifest
then that his fatal illness had begun.
</p>

<p>
Laurence was a more frequent guest of ours
than Harry, especially at Christmas time,
having no children to command his presence at
home; he was not so trammelled on the stage
as his brother; it was easier for him to escape
from perpetual reminders.  The performances I
remember best on his part are his high-class
acting in <i>Typhoon</i> and the admirable drawing
of a character he played in <i>The Incubus</i>, who is,
in point of fact, his mistress and has become
sadly in the way.  My wife and I saw the play
together from a stage box, and were much
amused at the end of it by a conversation
between what we took to be a young married
couple in the stalls, just beneath us.
</p>

<p>
The girl said: "Good play, isn't it?"  The
man answered: "Capital.  I've only one fault
to find with it."  "What's that?"  "Title."  "Title,
why it's a perfect title."  The man:
"Rotten title&mdash;it's nothing about an incubus."
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
The girl: "It's all about an incubus."  The
man: "The thing was never once mentioned."  The
girl, in amazement: "What is an
incubus?"  The man: "Why, one of those
things in which they hatch chickens."
</p>

<p>
The sons died at an age that is not closed
to hope and promise, which now must be
handed on to another generation&mdash;Laurence
and Elizabeth, the children of Harry Irving,
both gifted with good looks and charm.  The
boy distinguished himself during the War in
the Air Force and now shows promise as a
painter.  My love descends to them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
J. L. Toole
</span>
</p>

<p>
Extremes meet; they always do and always
will.  The closest friend Henry Irving had was
J. L. Toole.  The strong affection between the
two men, which lasted until the end, began
when Toole was making a name on the stage
in Edinburgh and Irving only a beginner.  The
famous comedian belonged, as it were, to "the
City," and was educated at the City of London
School.  He was a close second to Sothern in
inventing practical jokes, generally harmless,
and would take as infinite pains to carry them
through.  I remember a silly story he loved
to tell, how, after a bad baccarat night at
Aix-les-Bains, he went to the bank to draw
money on his letter of credit.  Tapping at the
<i>guichet</i>, he inquired of the clerk in feeble,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
broken English how much the bank would
advance upon a gold-headed cane which he
carried.  As might be expected, the little
window was slammed in his face.  Nothing
daunted, Toole made his way to the market-place
hard by, and bought from various stalls
some small fish, a bunch of carrots, and a
child's toy; he then returned to the bank and
arranged his purchases on the counter, with
the addition of his watch, a half-franc piece and
a penknife.  When all was ready he again
tapped at the window, and, in a tremulous
voice, implored the clerk to accept these
offerings in pledge for the small sum needed to
save him from starvation.  The clerk indignantly
requested Toole to leave the establishment,
explaining, in the best English at his
command, that the bank only made advances
upon letters of credit.  At the last-named
word Toole broke into smiles, and, producing
his letter of credit, handed it to the astonished
clerk, with the explanation that he would have
offered it at first had he thought the bank cared
about it, but the porter at his hotel had
emphatically told him the bankers of Aix
preferred fish.
</p>

<p>
Toole was never the same after the painful
death of his son: he became more and more
a slave to "late hours," but was still a delightful,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P194"></a>194}</span>
buoyant companion, beloved by his
comrades and friends.
</p>

<p>
Wilson Barrett was a good actor of the
robust type.  He had an adventurous career:
sometimes high on the wave of success, at
others deep down in the trough of the sea of
failure, but always strictly honourable.  At
the old Princess's Theatre, in Oxford Street, he
made large sums by good dramas like <i>The
Silver King</i> and <i>The Lights of London</i>, and lost
them through the failures of ambitious efforts,
which included a youthful <i>Hamlet</i>, to be wiped
out in turn by the enormous success of <i>The
Sign of the Cross</i>, a religious drama that
appealed to a large public which rarely
entered theatres.  The play provoked Bernard
Shaw to say that Wilson Barrett could always
bring down the house with a hymn, and had
so evident a desire to personate the Messiah
that we might depend upon seeing him
crucified yet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
William Terriss
</span>
</p>

<p>
A restless, untamable spirit was born in
William Terriss.  He tried various callings
before settling down to the one for which he
was so eminently fitted.  He embarked in the
mercantile marine, but the craze only lasted
a fortnight.  Then came tea-planting in China.
The next experiment was made in medicine, to
be followed by an attack upon engineering.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
He then positively bluffed me into giving him
an engagement, and made his appearance on
the stage.  Suddenly he decided to go sheep
farming in the Falkland Islands.  He made an
early marriage, and his beloved Ellaline was
born there.  Of course he soon came back;
returned to and left the stage again; next to
Kentucky to try horse-breeding.  Another
failure brought him to his senses.  Five years
after he had first adopted the stage he was an
actor in earnest and became one of its greatest
favourites.
</p>

<p>
His career was chiefly identified with the
Lyceum and the Adelphi; but he first became
prominent by his acting as Thornhill in
<i>Olivia</i>, under Hare's management at the Court
Theatre.  His bright, breezy nature was a
tonic, and, like his daughter and her husband,
Seymour Hicks, he carried sunshine about with
him and shed it on all he met.  He was as
brave as a lion and as graceful as a panther.
</p>

<p>
Alas! one Saturday evening the town was
horrified as the tragic news quickly spread that
Terriss had been fatally stabbed by a malignant
madman as he was entering the Adelphi
Theatre to prepare for his evening's work.  At
his funeral there was an extraordinary
manifestation of public sympathy.
</p>

<p>
Lionel Monckton told me a curious story of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
how when he reached home he found that a
clock which Terriss gave him had stopped at
the hour of the murder.
</p>

<p>
However briefly, I must record grateful
thanks for past enjoyment given us by Corney
Grain, as great a master in his branch of art
as that friend of my youth, John Parry.  His
odd name was often wrongly thought to be
assumed, as was that of a dramatist of those
days, Stirling Coyne, who rejoiced in the
nickname of "Filthy Lucre."
</p>

<p>
I always remember the stifled laughter of
my wife and Corney Grain, who was present
with ourselves at a dinner party, when a
distinguished foreigner, accredited by Spain
to the Court of St. James, was announced
by a nervous manservant as the "Spanish
Ham..."&mdash;a long pause being followed
by a trembling sotto voce&mdash;"bassador."
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
"Gee Gee" and "Wee Gee"
</span>
</p>

<p>
George Grossmith, the elder&mdash;"Gee Gee"&mdash;is
of course best remembered by his long
connection with the Gilbert and Sullivan
operas.  To their great success he contributed
a share of which he was justly proud.  After
he left the Savoy Theatre he toured as an
entertainer, with excellent financial results,
both here and from two visits to the United
States.  When he returned for the second time,
I remember his saying to me, in his funny,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
plaintive way: "Do you know, my dear
'B,' things are really very sad.  The first
time I came back from America I found myself
spoken of as 'Weedon Grossmith's brother,'
and now, after my second visit, I am only
'George Grossmith's father.'"
</p>

<p>
I have always looked upon Weedon
Grossmith&mdash;"Wee Gee"&mdash;as an admirable actor,
and his death as bringing a personal loss,
having valued his friendship and his company.
On the stage I best remember him in Pinero's
comedies, <i>The Cabinet Minister</i> and <i>The
Amazons</i>, in <i>A Pantomime Rehearsal</i>, and,
towards the end of his career, in a remarkable
performance of a demented odd creature, who
believed himself to be the great Napoleon.  My
wife was so impressed by the acting that she
wrote to our little friend about it in a way
which delighted him beyond words.  Weedon
was educated as a painter, and became an
exhibitor at the Academy and other galleries.
I have two charming examples from his brush,
which I bought at Christie's.
</p>

<p>
The Great War dealt severe blows to the
stage, many a young life of promise being
taken.  The toll was heavy; but they are
honoured always by their comrades and remembered
for their valour, as are those who served
so bravely and survived.  During those
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P198"></a>198}</span>
terrible years the stage also lost E. S. Willard,
Lewis Waller, Herbert Tree, William Kendal
and George Alexander&mdash;all men in the front
rank; every one hard to replace.
</p>

<p>
I associate Willard with his success in <i>The
Silver King</i>, and afterwards in Henry Arthur
Jones's plays, <i>The Middleman</i> and <i>Judah</i>.
In these he had a prosperous career through the
United States&mdash;as in the part in which I best
remember him&mdash;the old man in Barrie's comedy,
<i>The Professor's Love Story</i>, a charming piece
of artistic work.  He owed a modest fortune
to the appreciation he met with in America.
</p>

<p>
Willard had an ambition to build a theatre
at the top of Lower Regent Street, where the
County Fire Office, so long a London landmark,
stood; but, granting the site to have been
available, it had no depth: the theatre could
only have been erected on a part of the Regent
Palace Hotel, and reached by burrowing under
the road&mdash;so far as my architectural knowledge
serves me.  With the demolition of the County
Fire Office the last fragment of the old colonnade
disappeared, which, I remember, in my boyhood
extended on both sides of the Quadrant from
the Circus to Vigo Street.
</p>

<p>
Early retirement from management prevented
intimacy with several prominent actors,
who otherwise might have been associated
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
with our work.  For instance, Lewis Waller
was only once our guest, as things happened.
Of his acting, my wife and I were among the
warm admirers.  The first play in which he
commanded our attention was <i>The Profligate</i>,
which Pinero wrote for Hare when his
management of the Garrick Theatre began.  One
recalls with admiration his acting as Hotspur,
Brutus, Faulconbridge, and King Henry V.
</p>

<p>
I am sorry I did not know him better, or
see more of him.  He was a great loss to the
stage he loved.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Too many windows
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was, naturally, a satisfaction to my wife,
as to me, when Herbert Tree became our
successor at the Haymarket.  We felt the future
of the theatre to be secure for a while, and that
its traditions would be worthily maintained.
He did all sorts of good work there, ranging
from <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Henry V</i> to <i>The Dancing
Girl</i> and <i>Trilby</i>, until he was responsible for
building its beautiful opposite neighbour, the
present His Majesty's Theatre, where he
migrated.  During its erection I was walking
one day on the opposite side with Comyns
Carr, who asked me what I thought of it.  He
seemed to be greatly amused by my answer:
"Too many windows to clean."
</p>

<p>
Good fortune continued to smile upon the
smaller house under the joint management of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P200"></a>200}</span>
Frederick Harrison and Cyril Maude.  Much
of its deserved success was due, in those days,
to the art of Winifred Emery, which was then
approaching its best, before cruel disease came
in the plenitude of her powers and robbed her
of that very front position which is reached by
so few, and which I think she would surely
have attained in her maturity.
</p>

<p>
Herbert Tree was for many years a power
and an authority upon our stage: he rendered
its alluring profession great service.  I still
trust in the hope that successors may be found
with something of his splendid courage, his
boundless imagination, to follow in his firmest
footsteps and leave as memorable marks.
</p>

<p>
In private life he was an amusing creature,
a delightful companion, a perfect host.  It
was once said of him, not altogether without
truth, that he walked in a dream, talked in a
dream, ate in a dream, drank in a dream,
smoked in a dream, and acted in a dream.
</p>

<p>
He had enormous energy in starting things,
but less strength in carrying his ideas through:
he grew tired quickly through his love of
change.
</p>

<p>
I will end with a comic note, for which I am
indebted to Pinero.  It so happened that the
names of Arthur Pinero and Herbert Tree were
announced for knighthood in the same Honours
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
List.  A man who was an old friend of both
wrote a letter of felicitation to each of them;
but unfortunately he put his letters into the
wrong envelopes.  The one Pinero received
was as follows: "My dear Tree.  Hearty
congratulations.  You ought to have had it long
ago.  But why Pinero?"  The distinguished
dramatist sent this letter to the distinguished
actor with the necessary explanation, and in
return had from him the note intended for
himself.  This was it: "My dear Pinero.
Hearty congratulations.  You ought to have
had it long ago.  But why Tree?"

The Kendals
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Will" Kendal, until he "passed into the
night," chanced to be my oldest theatrical
friend.  We first met at Birmingham, in our
early struggling days, and not again until he
had planted his feet firmly at the Haymarket.
Mrs. Kendal I knew in the following year,
when we acted together in the country.  She
was Madge Robertson then, and a "flapper"
of fifteen, already foreshadowing her brilliant
future.  After the Kendals married, my wife
and I had the great advantage of their services
in our company for two seasons.  When,
later on, their successful partnership with
Hare came to an end, they travelled much in
America, where they became special favourites
and amassed a large fortune.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
</p>

<p>
Kendal was an actor in the foremost rank,
being trained by some years of hard work in
the provincial "stock companies," as we of
the "old brigade" all were.  There were
certain parts he played to perfection.  I never
saw his equal as Captain Absolute in <i>The
Rivals</i>, young Marlow in <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>,
and Charles Courtly in <i>London Assurance</i>.
</p>

<p>
It must be full five and forty years since
George Alexander called upon my wife one
Sunday afternoon with a letter of introduction
from our dear friend, Sir Morell Mackenzie.
We were sorry, for all our sakes, that we could
only offer him encouragement.  He had much
in his favour; was acting with a travelling
company in the Robertson comedies, and
warmly recommended for a London engagement,
which he soon received from Irving at the
Lyceum.  Many pleasant tributes from Ellen
Terry were paid to him during his stay there,
and he rendered yeoman service to his chief.
Alexander's long and successful management
of the St. James's Theatre was beyond reproach,
and for years gave stability to the stage and
good repute to those who worked with him.
He was a staunch friend to English dramatists
and produced plays written by Arthur Pinero,
Henry Arthur Jones, Alfred Sutro, Anthony
Hope, Claude Carton, Haddon Chambers, Louis
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P203"></a>203}</span>
Parker, Stephen Phillips, Oscar Wilde, and
Henry James: a worthy record.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
"Mrs. Tanqueray"
</span>
</p>

<p>
The finest feather in Alexander's managerial
cap&mdash;his <i>panache</i>&mdash;was the production of
Pinero's great play, <i>The Second Mrs. Tanqueray</i>.
He alone had the courage&mdash;a quality most
essential in theatrical enterprise&mdash;to risk what
thirty years ago was a dangerous undertaking,
the truth and humanity of the play, which has
kept it vigorously alive, being at the time of
its production lost sight of in the sensation
caused by the selection of such a daring scheme
and subject for the stage.  That fears existed
for the success of the play on that score may
now excite wonder in the minds of the present
advanced generation.
</p>

<p>
The part of Paula has been a vehicle for the
widely differing genius and conceptions of so
many eminent actresses&mdash;Mrs. Patrick
Campbell, Duse, Jane Hading, Mrs. Kendal, Miss
Gladys Cooper, and numerous other
distinguished foreigners&mdash;that special interest
attaches to the curious incidents surrounding
the first production of the play and the
original casting of the heroine.
</p>

<p>
The play was in the first instance offered
to Hare, who very decidedly refused it.  On
Hare's rejection, it was offered to Alexander,
who, though greatly impressed by its strength,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P204"></a>204}</span>
also, but reluctantly, declined it.  Pinero
then proposed to Alexander that he should do
the play at a <i>matinée</i>, without being asked for
any author's fee.  This proposal was agreed
to; and the play was announced for a series
of morning performances.  It happened, however,
that Alexander's forthcoming production
was <i>Liberty Hall</i>, a comedy written by Claude
Carton, who, not unnaturally, represented to
Alexander that the performances of <i>The Second
Mrs. Tanqueray</i> in the afternoons might militate
against the success of the regular evening bill.
(An odd little coincidence is that one of the
characters in <i>Liberty Hall</i> was originally named
Tanqueray&mdash;a name which Carton, out of
consideration for Pinero, changed to Harringay.)
Alexander thereupon undertook that, if Pinero
would release him from his agreement to give
morning performances of <i>The Second Mrs. Tanqueray</i>,
he would at the earliest opportunity
put the play into the evening bill.  In these
circumstances the play was produced towards
the end of the season of 1893.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The first Paula
</span>
</p>

<p>
In the ordinary course the original Paula
would have been Winifred Emery, but the
expected arrival of one of her daughters
robbed her of the chance.  The choice at the
time was very limited, actresses of prominence
all being engaged.  It happened, however,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P205"></a>205}</span>
that at the Adelphi a young and handsome
lady of no long stage experience, named
Mrs. Patrick Campbell, was acting in a drama by
G. R. Sims.  There were doubts whether the
methods of an actress who had graduated at
the Adelphi were suitable to the St. James's,
but Pinero suggested to Alexander that they
should see what impression she produced upon
them in a talk with her in a room.  The
interview took place, and after it Pinero told
Alexander that, if she would act on the stage
as she talked in his office, he felt pretty sure
that she was the woman for the part.  But
her engagement was dependent on her release
by the management of the Adelphi.  Word
promptly came that this was refused, and once
more the author of the play and the manager
of the St. James's were up to their necks in
difficulties.  Pinero then proposed to Alexander
that he should wind up the matter by engaging
Miss Elizabeth Robins, who had lately made
a striking success in Ibsen's <i>Hedda Gabler</i>, and
he proceeded to do so.
</p>

<p>
As was the custom then, the date and hour
were fixed for the author to read his play to
the actors and actresses who were to represent
it.  Alexander was engaged to have luncheon
that day in Portland Place, and Pinero arranged
to call for him on his way to the theatre.  As
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
he drove up in a hansom, Alexander came out
of the house in a state of great excitement,
crying out: "We can get Mrs. Campbell!"
</p>

<p>
It appeared that he had only just heard from
her that, thanks to pressure put upon them by
G. R. Sims, the managers of the Adelphi had
consented to release her.  On reaching the
St. James's Theatre, Pinero said to Alexander:
"Look here; this is your job.  I will go for
a walk in St. James's Park and come back in
half an hour to read my play either to Miss
Robins or Mrs. Campbell, as it may turn
out."
</p>

<p>
Alexander went to his room, rang the bell,
asked if Miss Robins had arrived, and on
learning that she was in the theatre requested
her to come and see him.  She soon entered,
holding the book of the play.  Alexander told
her that an unexpected condition of things
had arisen.  He would put his cards on the
table.  Did Miss Robins know that the part of
Paula had been first offered to Mrs. Campbell,
who, in fact, had been engaged to play it?
He was answered: "Yes."  Alexander then
said: "She has been set free, and is in the
theatre.  What am I to do?"
</p>

<p>
Pointing to the book in her hand, Miss
Robins replied: "Mr. Alexander, this is the
chance of my life.  It is also the chance of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P207"></a>207}</span>
Mrs. Campbell's life.  She is a friend of mine,
and I will not take the chance from her."
</p>

<p>
It was, in my opinion, a great mistake on
Alexander's part to add the cares of the London
County Council to the management of an
important theatre.  The strain, I have no
doubt, shortened his life, which was of great
service to his calling.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Sir Frank Benson
</span>
</p>

<p>
"Alec" was always my good friend; and
when he summoned a meeting of the leading
actors and managers in 1916, the year the
Shakespearean Tercentenary was to be
celebrated at Drury Lane Theatre, he put the
matter so strongly to those assembled that
there was no gainsaying his suggestion that
I should there and then be invited to speak the
address on the occasion if, as he hoped, I
would undertake the task.  It was no mean
effort, and I am afraid that egotism is again
fast getting the better of me and urging me to
print the result of my labour.  My excuse is
that the event had national importance: a
dramatic episode being the knighthood
conferred by the King on Frank Benson, who had
given the best years of his life to spreading the
love of Shakespeare throughout the land.
</p>

<p>
Here is the address:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I am proud, indeed, that it was thought
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
fitting by my comrades to give me the unsought
honour, on this great day, of addressing you
on their behalf.  I thank them for the privilege
with all my heart, and promise to bear in mind
the wise counsel of Polonius, 'brevity is the
soul of wit!'  I can only speak from my point
of view.  There are debts which can never be
paid in full; there is homage which never can
be amply rendered; there is love no tongue
can truly tell.  All these are Shakespeare's.
As every tribute must fall short of what is
really due, I resolved to speak my own words&mdash;the
best in my power to frame&mdash;rather than
be but the echo of an abler brain.
</p>

<p>
"In my early days in theatreland, with the
audacity of youth, I acted many characters in
Shakespeare's plays and then laid some budding
leaves of a modest chaplet at the shrine of the
master whose works have made the stage
eternal.  Now, in my old age, I rejoice in the
remembrance that I have been what William
Shakespeare was&mdash;an actor.  With a boundless
prodigality he has enriched this England which
claims his birth&mdash;the dear land he loved so
deeply and called:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'This fortress built by Nature for herself,<br>
  This precious stone set in the silver sea.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"We owe to Shakespeare the most alluring,
the most entrancing creations in our
mother-tongue.  How much poorer should we be if
we lacked the imperishable charm of those
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P209"></a>209}</span>
Princesses of the drama&mdash;Juliet, Rosalind,
Ophelia, Beatrice, Viola, Miranda, Portia,
Imogen, Desdemona, and Cordelia.  They are
not withered by age, nor stricken by decay.
The Angel of Death passes them by.  They
are celestial and immortal.  What joy that
mighty pen must have given for three hundred
years to the gifted women who have portrayed
those matchless heroines.
</p>

<p>
"As Shakespeare is 'for all time,' so is he
for all men the 'guide, philosopher, and
friend.'  From whom can even monarchs surer
look for majesty?  Who so inspires the statesman
with true patriotism?  Who so teaches the
gentleman his conduct; the preacher simple
piety; the soldier chivalry and courage?  Who
gives the poet nobler themes; the painter
loftier models; the lover sweeter idols; a son
such sound advice?  Who so plainly tells the
player of his faults? and by whom is youth so
upheld by hope, or declining years so soothed
with consolation?
</p>

<p>
"I remember well a visit I paid upon a
dusky evening to Westminster Abbey.  As I
walked beneath its stately roof, to the sounds
of the organ, twilight shadows were cast down
the sacred aisles.  It seemed easy under such
influence to believe the legend that, while
writing the awful scene between Hamlet and
his father's ghost, Shakespeare passed a long
night alone within those hallowed walls.  In
the fading light I looked upon the monument
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P210"></a>210}</span>
in Poets' Corner and read the lines from <i>The
Tempest</i> as they are inscribed there:
</p>

<p>
  'The cloudcapt towers, the gorgeous palaces,<br>
  The solemn temples, the great globe itself,<br>
  Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve;<br>
  And like the baseless Fabric of a Vision<br>
  Leave not a wrack behind.'<br>
</p>

<p>
What grandeur, what pathos, are in the words;
but we will not believe them&mdash;at least not of
him.  The lustre&mdash;the undying lustre&mdash;Shakespeare's
transcendent genius has shed upon the
world marches down the ages undimmed by
time."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I lately came across a tribute to Shakespeare
which provoked alike my admiration and
surprise: the author being that brilliant wit
and humorist, Douglas Jerrold.  These are
his words:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"The great magician who has left immortal
company for the spirit of man in his weary
journey through this briary world&mdash;has
bequeathed scenes of immortal loveliness for
the human fancy to delight in&mdash;founts of
eternal truth for the lip of man to drink, and
drink&mdash;and for all time to be renovated with
every draught."

Charles Wyndham
</span>
</p>

<p>
Of that accomplished and delightful
comedian, Charles Wyndham, there are bright
thoughts of the happiness he gave to playgoers
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P211"></a>211}</span>
during an exceptionally prolonged career.  Its
only blemish, indeed, was its length, when the
inevitable decay, which at last declines to be
warded off, became manifest towards the end.
</p>

<p>
His early successes were made at the
Criterion Theatre, in plays of an amusing and
frivolous kind, such as <i>The Great Divorce Case</i>,
<i>Pink Dominoes</i> and <i>Betsy</i>.  These were followed
by far better work, of a higher kind, and the
production of those admirable comedies by
Henry Arthur Jones, <i>The Case of Rebellious
Susan</i> and <i>The Liars</i>.
</p>

<p>
I confess to having thought, had I remained
longer on the stage, how happy I should have
been to have played some types of those
delightful, helpful, elderly men, who often make
life pleasanter to the young, and were so
perfectly acted by Wyndham.
</p>

<p>
He retained his youthful appearance until
late in life: the preservation of his "figure"
was amazing, and he remained a good walker
to the end, but never carried a cane.
</p>

<p>
To recall a peculiarity of his hard working
days, I have frequently known him stop at a
post office and scrawl a hurried letter or send
a telegram to himself, as a reminder of
something important that he had to remember or
to do.
</p>

<p>
The memory of Charles Wyndham should
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P212"></a>212}</span>
always be held in high regard for his unbounded
generosity and devoted service to the Actors'
Benevolent Fund.  It was a pleasure and a
privilege to me to propose that Lady Wyndham
should be chosen to follow in his footsteps as
its president.
</p>

<p>
Charles Hawtrey was a very old friend.  We
knew him first at his father's well-known
preparatory school for Eton, where I sent my son.
The next phase came soon afterwards, when
he confided to us his wish to go upon the stage;
a wish my wife and I at once encouraged.
This appeared a little before we commenced our
Haymarket career with a revival of Lord
Lytton's comedy, <i>Money</i>.  We said he could
appear as a young member in the club scene,
with a few lines to speak.  Hawtrey enthusiastically
accepted the offer.  Unfortunately, an
illness prevented its fulfilment, or he would
have been the companion of Fred Terry in
making his first appearance on that eventful
evening.
</p>

<p>
Our paths in life, both on and off the stage,
were much asunder, but we were always the
best of friends, and I remember with pleasure
a strong wish he expressed, during one of our
meetings at Marienbad, when a scheme was on
foot to build a theatre for him in the Haymarket,
that he might christen it "The Bancroft."
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P213"></a>213}</span>
My wife and I were sorry when the scheme fell
through.
</p>

<p>
He leaves the happiest memories to his
shoals of friends&mdash;from the early days, of <i>The
Private Secretary</i>; the middle stage, of <i>Lord
and Lady Algy</i> and <i>The Man from Blankley's</i>;
to end, with the gay maturity of <i>Ambrose
Applejohn's Adventure</i>,&mdash;and laughter all the
way.
</p>

<p>
Charles Hawtrey was the actor I have
alluded to who had the widest knowledge of
the Bible of any layman I have known.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
John Hare
</span>
</p>

<p>
My intimate and affectionate relations, both
private and professional, with John Hare make
me a little shy of writing about him with the
warmth his long and brilliant career upon the
stage deserves.  I was his oldest professional
friend, having been a member of the company
he first joined.  In the following year my wife
offered him an engagement, and for ten years
he was prominent among the attractive company
of the old Prince of Wales's Theatre.  No
young actor was, perhaps, so fortunate as
himself, appearing as he did in three such successive
and distinctive character parts as Lord Ptarmigant,
the sleepy old Peer in <i>Society</i>, Prince
Perovsky, the courtly Russian diplomat in
<i>Ours</i>, and Sam Gerridge, the humble gasfitter
in <i>Caste</i>.  The delicacy and finish of Hare's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P214"></a>214}</span>
acting was of great service to the Robertson
comedies, in all of which he appeared.
</p>

<p>
When he left us it was to enter into friendly
managerial rivalry.  I applauded the step as
a wise one on his part; but, after so many
years of close intimacy, I felt the wrench.
From that moment the dressing-room he and
I had shared knew me no more, and I found a
lonely corner on another floor.
</p>

<p>
And a friendly rivalry it was.  If we had our
<i>Diplomacy</i>, he had his <i>Olivia</i>, a delightful play,
in which Ellen Terry made so conspicuous a
success and Terriss laid the firm foundation
of his fine career.  My sole disappointment in
connection with this beautiful production was
that Hare had not plucked up the courage
to attack the part of the dear old Vicar
himself.
</p>

<p>
It is not for me to dwell upon his career,
which was always to the credit of his calling,
or enumerate his successes, only naming
Pinero's brilliant works, <i>The Notorious
Mrs. Ebbsmith</i> and <i>The Gay Lord Quex</i>.  In the first
of them Mrs. Patrick Campbell clinched her
previous triumph; in the second Irene Vanbrugh
seized the opportunity of rushing to the
front, where she has remained ever since.
</p>

<p>
On an occasion when Hare proposed my
health in distinguished company, it was pleasant
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P215"></a>215}</span>
to listen to words which were too flattering to
allow of their repetition.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Meissonier of our stage
</span>
</p>

<p>
I am inclined to say that Hare's best and
most complete individual work was his delightful
portrait of old Benjamin Goldfinch in <i>A
Pair of Spectacles</i>, a performance which gave
us something of the simplicity and benevolence
of the immortal Samuel Pickwick.  I think
of Hare, in all he did, as the Meissonier of our
stage.

ONE OTHER EMPTY CHAIR

<p class="poem">
  "If we really love those whom we lose,<br>
  We never really lose those whom we love."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The time has come for me to offer my apology
for this book.  In my lonely, but not unhappy,
old age, the most void of all the Empty Chairs
which now surround me is the one so long
filled by my partner for more than fifty years.
</p>

<p>
Let me begin by saying that the foundation
of our fortunes was due, solely, to her courage
in gallantly deciding that danger was preferable
to dullness, and in producing <i>Society</i>, the
first of the Robertson comedies, against adverse
advice and the fact that the manuscript had
been "turned down" by the leading London
managers of the day.  It may be that the brave
decision was also pleasant to her because at
the time our mutual attachment was steadily
ripening, and, although the part she was willing
to take was not prominent, the character which
would fall to my lot was a good one and likely to
advance my position, if I played it well.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P217"></a>217}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The return to Nature
</span>
</p>

<p>
To the exceptional and startling success
upon production of Robertson's five delicate
little comedies, and to the frequently-recurring
revivals of them, we owed much.  They
appeared just when they were wanted to revive
interest in the drama.  Nature was Robertson's
goddess, and he looked upon the bright young
manager as the high-priestess of the natural
school of acting.
</p>

<p>
When the prolific fountain ceased, through
the early and untimely death of Robertson, the
choice of plays until the end of our career was
left to me.  I was honoured and helped by
implicit confidence in my judgment; no word
of rebuke passed her lips for a mistake, no
word of praise was withheld when it was
thought merited.  No spark of professional
jealousy was born to her; she always loved to
act with the ablest and best equipped of her
comrades.  She had no place for the more
sordid side of life, and was as free from
extravagance as she was indifferent about money.
Her life from childhood was passed in the
service of the public until I thought the time
had come for it to be less strenuous.
</p>

<p>
It may be that for the early withdrawal from
triumphant scenes of the great gifts of so
famous an actress I was to blame&mdash;if blame
there was.  I plead excuse in a painful
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P218"></a>218}</span>
remembrance of pitiful words, written by a
powerful pen, on lingering too long upon the
stage; words which drew the sad picture of a
much-loved servant of the public clinging to
the faded chaplet won as its idol in earlier
days; of clutching at the withered trophy after
the time had come for its graceful surrender
to youth and promise, and before the admiration
once so showered upon her should be
replaced by indulgence&mdash;indulgence to be
followed by compassion, compassion in its turn
by indifference.  Indulgence&mdash;compassion&mdash;indifference.
The mere utterance of such words
causes one pain.  Twilight in art&mdash;as in
nature&mdash;must be mournful: surely a sweeter picture is
the splendid sinking of an early autumnal sun.
</p>

<p>
It will mean happiness to me to lay a few
flowers at her feet, gathered in the gardens of
those who knew and loved her.  So I have
asked three dear friends, a man of letters, a
dramatist, and an actor, to help me in that task.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Macready and the child
</span>
</p>

<p>
The first tribute is from the pen of W. L. Courtney:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
"MY DEAR B,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I gladly avail myself of the opportunity
you give me to pay a tribute to the memory
of Lady Bancroft.
</p>

<p>
"She herself has told us the sort of impression
she made on those around her when she was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P219"></a>219}</span>
a child; and because that early verdict
passed on her is singularly prescient, it is
worth recalling.  Macready is the first witness.
Marie Wilton&mdash;to use her maiden name, which
was soon to be famous on the stage&mdash;acted the
parts of the boy Fleance and the apparition
of a child in the caldron scene to Macready's
Macbeth at the close of his career, and was
invited by the great actor to visit him in his
room.  'Well,' he said, 'I suppose you hope
to be a great actress some day.  And what do
you intend to play?'  The answer came at
once: 'Lady Macbeth.'  'Oh, is that all!
Well, I like your ambition.  You are a strange
little thing and have such curious eyes.  But
you must change them before you play Lady
Macbeth, or you will make your audience
laugh instead of cry.'  The story shows that
Macready had quickly noticed two things about
the child.  Her eyes, which were not so much
curious as unusual and always alive, were
laughing, merry, twinkling eyes, the eyes of
one who would never allow her outlook on the
world to be other than genial and good; who
could bear misfortune with as much courage
as good fortune.  He had noticed also what
was almost the first thing that the spectator
observed about Marie Bancroft's performance
in almost every one of her parts, and that
was the inscrutable fashion in which she at
once established the best relations with her
audience.  It was in its way a little bit of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P220"></a>220}</span>
magic, the secret of which she retained.  The
effect was irresistible.  She came down to the
footlights, or stayed where she was, without
movement, and instantly flashes of mutual
goodwill passed between her and the audience,
even before the musical tones of her voice
were heard.  Sometimes, as with an actress
like Eleonora Duse, time has to elapse while
she is, so to speak, making herself at home.
Marie Bancroft had undoubtedly what I have
called a little bit of magic.  Whatever the part
that she was to play, there was always the
comfortable feeling when she was on the stage
that everything was going well, and that
success was practically assured.  In the series
of her parts in the Robertsonian drama she
was, of course, helped by the author's
knowledge of her and of her temperament; but
whether she was a schoolgirl or supposed to
be grown up; whether the part belonged to the
upper or the lower levels of society: in every
case sympathy was instantly linking her with
the eager and attentive house.  She no sooner
came than she saw what was wanted, and she
conquered with what seemed consummate ease
and economy of effort.  I have never seen
an actress who more rapidly and easily made
her presence known on the stage as a gracious,
winsome, affectionate creature, filled with
human kindness, and always ready to believe
the best of people and of things.

Dickens and the girl
</span>
</p>

<p>
"And so the judgment of Charles Dickens is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P221"></a>221}</span>
established as surely as that of Macready.  'I
really wish,' said Dickens in a letter to John
Forster, 'I really wish you would go to see
<i>The Maid and the Magpie</i> burlesque at the
Strand Theatre.  There is the strangest thing
in it that I have ever seen on the stage.  The
boy Pippo, by Miss Marie Wilton, while it is
astonishingly impudent&mdash;must be or it could
not be done at all&mdash;is so stupendously like a
boy and unlike a woman that it is perfectly
free from offence.  I have never seen such a
curious thing; the manner, the appearance,
the levity, impulse and spirits of it are so exactly
like a boy that you cannot see anything like
her sex in association with it.  I call her the
cleverest girl I have ever seen on the stage in
my time, and the most original.'  That is, of
course, a tribute to her cleverness, which made
her the best of burlesque actresses.  If
Macready's judgment refers to the seriousness of
her ambition, Charles Dickens calls attention
to her extraordinary versatility, her power of
identifying herself with any part she assumed,
and the rapidity with which she comprehended
all that was implicit in it.  Of the burlesques
of those days Marie Wilton was the acknowledged
queen, inspiring the whole of the silly
or serious business with her inimitable gaiety
and amazing ability.
</p>

<p>
"The more general the sympathy an actress
possesses with human nature, the wider will
be her interpretation of a part.  We talk
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P222"></a>222}</span>
about building up a character.  It is only
saying in other words that the primary duty
of the heroine in a play is to make us
understand, not only what she is in the play, but
what she might be under other conditions.
The extraordinary thing about Marie Bancroft,
when she left burlesque for modern comedy,
is that from the first she interpreted the
character she was representing in the largest,
most sympathetic manner, as having an inner
nature or temperament of much more subtle
value than came out in the actual presentation.
Superficially, the characters of Polly Eccles
and Naomi Tighe&mdash;both great favourites with
Marie Bancroft&mdash;can be easily described.  They
are bright, garrulous, happy creatures, full of
fun, quick in tongue, responsive to humour,
and always amusing to watch.  But as we left
the theatre, after seeing her act them, we were
aware that they are something more.  Behind
the drolleries of Naomi Tighe beats an extremely
warm heart, a genuine comradeship, and an
especial love, of course, of her dear friend,
Bella.  But in Polly Eccles there was still
more.  I was always surprised to think that
Marie Bancroft should have preferred the
schoolgirl Naomi to the high-hearted, devoted
friend who was Polly Eccles, in whom we have
touches of a fuller personality than could be
found either in Naomi or in Mary Netley of
<i>Ours</i>.
</p>

<span class="sidenote">
The fulfilment
</span>
</p>

<p>
"These, however, were, after all, the earlier
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P223"></a>223}</span>
creations in comedy of an artist destined to do
much finer work.  Her full powers were
proved later on, especially in Peg Woffington.
The picture showed traces of the same handiwork;
and indeed the audience would never
have been satisfied if Marie Bancroft had not
set her unmistakeable seal on this character as
on others.  There was something in the pathos
of the main situation, however; something, too,
in the exquisite sympathy between Peg and
Triplet, which touched the very source of
tears.  What we saw here was the fulfilment
of a promise discerned in her earlier creations,
an admirable example of the many-sided
presentment of a character, so that it becomes
something of daily experience.  The humorous
eyes, the sensitive mouth, the face ever ready
to suggest laughter and fun, the attractive
little touches of temperament and feeling&mdash;those
had come together to form a beautiful
presentment of a gracious and affectionate
being, who could help others in their distress,
because she herself had come through deep
waters.
</p>

<p>
"There is one point which it would be wrong
to pass over without comment.  There is
sometimes talk of jealousy between artists.
Of the spirit of emulation, the spirit of ambition,
the desire to do the best possible under the
given conditions&mdash;of these, which are part and
parcel of a noble nature, Marie Bancroft had
her full share.  But it was always noticed that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P224"></a>224}</span>
she had no touch of professional jealousy.  She
often sank her own importance as an actress,
cheerfully taking a small part.  Both she and
you had made up your minds not to allow
consideration of your own parts to bias your
judgment in the refusal or acceptance of plays.
You judged the plays on their merits&mdash;not on
the ground that parts in them would or would
not suit either of you.  With the utmost
readiness Marie Bancroft played second parts
to Madame Modjeska, to Mrs. John Wood, to
Mrs. Patrick Campbell, as well as to
Mrs. Kendal and to Ellen Terry.  Self-abnegation
of this kind is sufficiently rare to be worthy
of comment.  Its value, is, of course, obvious.
Without it some of your most successful
productions would never have been given.
</p>

<p>
"Many critics, especially young ones, are
inclined to decry the value of Robertson's
plays; but the fact remains that, with those
comedies as your material, Marie Bancroft and
you initiated a revolution in English drama.
In those plays she rejoiced in characters
exactly suited to her genius, characters to
which she could give all her laughter and sense
of fun, in creating personalities which will
always live in the memories of those who saw
them.  She not only acted; she possessed
that constructive instinct which enabled her
to pass judgment on and vastly to improve
the comedies submitted to her.  Of this, there
is no better example than what happened with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P225"></a>225}</span>
Charles Reade's play, <i>Masks and Faces</i>, when
Reade, moved to tears by her performance of
the ending which at one rehearsal she
substituted for that which he had written, very
wisely gave way to the superior imaginative
perception of Marie Bancroft, the actress of
Peg Woffington.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Personality
</span>
</p>

<p>
"In final retrospect, we come back to the
'curious eyes' and the laughter-provoking
face which Macready discovered.  In all arts
we have to recognise the personal element,
which makes the work of one man so different
from that of another.  We do not mistake the
inimitable touch of a Millais or confuse it with
that of a Sargent.  We do not read a page of
Henry James and imagine that it could have
been written by George Meredith.  In the
same way an actor portraying a character
puts into it so much of himself that we contrast
his representation with that of another
actor&mdash;quite as good, perhaps, but of a different
quality.  This element of personality is called
'style,' and it is by style that an artist lives
and betrays his or her idiosyncrasy.  And no
one had a more appealing style than Marie
Bancroft, who could do with our hearts what
she pleased.  The roguish eyes, the inimitable
smile, the sense of humour, the joy of
living&mdash;all those were hers; and it was by some
wonderful combination of all dramatic gifts
that she won her complete and perfect triumph.
Those (alas! now how few) who in old days
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P226"></a>226}</span>
sat spellbound, as they saw her winning the
palms of victory in many a famous play, will
confess with unbounded gratitude how much
of happy memory they owe to the grace, the
skill, the charm, the sympathy of Marie
Bancroft.

"MY DEAR B.,
</p>

<p>
"It is my firm belief that the most
ardent and persistent lover of the drama, after
a long life of playgoing, and when the
footlights illuminating his own private and
personal drama are beginning to burn low, can,
if he be honest with himself, count his red-letter
nights in the theatre, at a liberal estimate,
on the fingers of both hands.  Such is the case
with me at any rate.  Many distinguished and
moving performances, memorable in their way,
have I witnessed; but the real, unmistakeable
red-letter nights&mdash;heart and brain clutching&mdash;how
few!  Some premieres at the old Lyceum,
under the management of the Batemans and,
subsequently, of Irving himself, two or three
representations at the Théâtre Français&mdash;notably
Mounet Sully's acting, as it was
thirty years ago, in <i>Œdipe Roi</i>&mdash;Duse's earliest
appearance in England in <i>La Dame aux
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P227"></a>227}</span>
Camélias</i>; to recall these things gives one a
catch in the breath&mdash;these and the first time
I saw Marie Wilton as 'Polly Eccles.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A red-letter night
</span>
</p>

<p>
"This particular red-letter night happened
at the Standard Theatre in Shoreditch in, I
think, August, 1873.  (You, in whose honour
a University should create the degree of
Master of Dates, so curious, so infallible&mdash;occasionally,
to the ladies, so disconcerting&mdash;is
your memory, will correct me if I am wrong
as to the month or year.)  The company of
the dainty little Prince of Wales's Theatre had
carried their delicate art to that not too
salubrious quarter of the town, and were delighting
the East-enders in Robertson's <i>Caste</i>.  Nowadays
it is the critical habit to sniff at Robertson
and his simple, humane comedies; but the
work of a writer for the stage should be judged
in relation to the period which produced it,
and, so judged, Robertson was a man of vision
and courage.  There is no dramatist now
writing, 'advanced' or otherwise, who is not
in a measure indebted to Robertson.  But how
lucky he was in the people who interpreted
him!  Take <i>Caste</i>, for instance.  Lydia
Foote&mdash;her appealing 'Esther Eccles' was
approached in later years only by Olga Brandon
in a revival of the piece at the Criterion&mdash;the
highly capable Mrs. Leigh Murray, the
unctuous Honey, John Hare, most refined of
miniaturists, the fascinating Coghlan&mdash;who had
succeeded Frederick Younge, whom I never
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P228"></a>228}</span>
saw, as 'George D'Alroy'&mdash;-yourself as
'Hawtree'&mdash;a monumental picture of Swelldom,
unequalled, in its combination of grotesqueness
and good breeding, by any stage Swell of my
time&mdash;even Sothern's 'Dundreary' couldn't
touch your 'Hawtree'&mdash;and, above and beyond
you all, the glorious actress who used to figure
in the playbills as 'Miss Marie Wilton
(Mrs. Bancroft),' and was to become Lady Bancroft;
what a wonderful&mdash;what an unmatchable&mdash;troupe!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
"Enter Polly"
</span>
</p>

<p>
"That red-letter night in unsavoury Shoreditch!
Outside the theatre, the thick air of
a warm evening, presently to be fouled by the
fumes of the naphtha lamps of the gutter
tradesmen; the incessant bawling of those
gentry; the garish display of cheap wares
in the shop-windows; the jostling and shoving
of the loiterers on the pavement; and the
sensation of complete happiness, almost choking
in its intensity, because one was going to
the play!  And the fight for a front seat in the
pit; the contentment, after a terrific struggle
resulting in a torn jacket and the limpest of
shirt-collars, at finding oneself in possession of about
eight inches of bare board; and the settling
down to enjoy the blended odours, peculiar to
the popular theatre of that day, of gas and stale
orange-peel, than which no more agreeable
smell could greet the nostrils of a stage-struck
youth!  Then the tuning-up by the orchestra&mdash;joyful
discord&mdash;and the unheeded playing of a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P229"></a>229}</span>
'selection'; and then the rising of the curtain,
the sudden hush of voices, and lo! there
is the poor, shabby room on the ground-floor
of the lodging-house in Stangate!  George
appears, followed by Hawtree; they talk, and
I wonder that their talk should be so different
from the talk I had heard in other plays; then
comes 'Papa Eccles,' who 'can tell a real
gentleman with half a sov'; then, when Papa,
the half-sovereign in his dirty fist, has shuffled
away to meet a friend round the corner,
Esther steals in; and then&mdash;oh, then!&mdash;'Enter
Polly, D.R.H.,' as the stage direction
says, and in a moment the audience is
enraptured by the brightest, freshest, sweetest
little woman that ever gladdened ears and
eyes in or out of a playhouse!
</p>

<p>
"Those, my dear B., who can remember
Lady Bancroft in the plenitude of her powers,
the fulness of her witchery, are&mdash;I speak
feelingly&mdash;rapidly growing fewer and fewer;
and it is with the aim, I suppose, of conveying
an impression of what she was at the time I
mention, and for at least a decade afterwards,
to the theatre-lovers of to-day&mdash;who saw her,
if they saw her at all, when age had begun
to weigh upon her&mdash;and to the theatre-lovers
of the future, that you are inviting two or three
men, old enough so to remember her, and who
yet linger more or less actively on the scene, to
contribute to your forthcoming book.  Phew!
A pretty difficult task, unless one employs
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P230"></a>230}</span>
language which in modern slang I understand
is called 'mushy.'  In the first place, of course,
she knew her business to her finger-tips.  That
a practitioner of any of the arts should have
known his or her business is frequently
remarked in disparagement.  Great artists,
however, will take care to include a knowledge of
their business&mdash;i.e. of the tricks of their
trade&mdash;among other accomplishments, one of the
latter being the faculty for hiding those tricks
from the public.  Lady Bancroft knew her
business&mdash;and other people's; that is, though
a born comedian, she could, if her physique
had allowed of it, have 'gone on,' in theatrical
phrase, for Lady Macbeth, or Juliet, or Ophelia,
and have triumphed.  (In fact, occasionally,
she did 'go on' for parts for which she was
hardly physically suited, and perhaps it was a
pity she didn't do so oftener.  She would have
been forgiven.)  And her experience,
commencing in babyhood, and her innate
cleverness, had taught her how, while keeping
strictly within the picture-frame, to button-hole,
as it were, each individual member of
the audience.  The man on the farthest bench
of the topmost gallery, as well as the man in
the stalls, was flattered by her skill into
believing that she was acting specially for him.  I
myself have watched her act from the sixpenny
gallery of a large theatre&mdash;that same Standard
in Shoreditch, the pit being beyond my means
for a second visit&mdash;and felt that she was so
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P231"></a>231}</span>
near to me that by stretching out my hand I
could have grasped hers.  As for her laugh, I
won't&mdash;I daren't&mdash;attempt to describe it,
because I should have to say that at one moment
it was like the trill of a singing-bird, at another
that it seemed not to be the music of her throat,
but to bubble up from her very soul; and that,
though gospel-truth, would be too terribly
mushy.  Nor her speaking-voice, because,
again, I should have to say that it had something
of the quality of the note of the purest
of silver bells; nor her eyes, because in mirth
they twinkled&mdash;thrice-hackneyed simile!&mdash;like
twin stars, and in expressing sorrow resembled
the little rain-pools when the sun has come
out after a summer shower; and to say
anything of the sort, while it would be equally
true, would also be mushy to an insupportable
degree.  But I will say, because it is just a
trifle less trite and banal, and because to do
her justice it ought to be said, that the secret
and source of her genius lay not in her
artistry&mdash;which was consummate&mdash;but in <i>herself</i>.  She
was a fine, warm-hearted creature, and her
acting was a reflection of the glow of her
innermost nature.

"Patches of shadow becloud every career,
however brilliant.  The tragedy of Lady
Bancroft's career was that after Robertson's death
no dramatist arose who could, or would, provide
her with material worthy of her talent.
For years, therefore, she retained her hold
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P232"></a>232}</span>
upon the public mainly by her 'Polly' in
<i>Caste</i>, 'Naomi Tighe' in <i>School</i>, and 'Mary
Netley' in <i>Ours</i>.  From time to time she acted
in new pieces by other authors, which lacked
the attraction of Robertson at his best; and
then, after giving us a captivating Lady
Teazle, and delighting us in revivals of some
other old comedies, in order to extend the
repertory of the theatre she gallantly
subordinated herself, when policy demanded it,
to playing parts of minor importance.  Towards
the end, spurred by a surviving ambition into
trying to make bricks without straw&mdash;and it
must be confessed that she made sounder
bricks without straw than did many an actress
who was supplied with stacks of that commodity&mdash;she
took to applying her ready wit to 'writing
up' the tiny parts she was condemned to play,
until at last her rare appearances became not
so much those of an actress engaged in
impersonating a character as of a charming lady
determined at all costs to be amusing.

"MY DEAR B,
</p>

<p>
"It is a great privilege to comply with
your wish.  It was in 1878 that I first met
Lady Bancroft.  She was then about to retire
for a holiday from the part of Zicka in
<i>Diplomacy</i>.  A year later I had the good fortune to
meet her on the stage when you engaged me
to act in <i>Ours</i>.  In the following year I moved
with the celebrated company from the Prince of
Wales's to the Haymarket Theatre, which had
been transformed by you into the most
beautiful theatre in London.  Here I was cast for
a part in <i>School</i>: hence it is my proud boast
that I acted with Marie Bancroft in her prime,
and was in personal touch with Mary Netley
and Naomi Tighe!
</p>

<p>
"Alas! it is not in me to convey to the
present generation the powers of this incomparable
actress.  The winsomeness, the cajolery,
the sprightly vivacity, the joyousness,
and the tenderness of it all!  Every note
could she play upon, and never was any note
forced.  The means by which she attained these
varied and subtle emotions were not to be
traced.  All appeared so simple, so illusive,
that it came home to one as being absolutely
true to nature.  She was complete mistress of
all the resources of her art, and yet those
resources were never laid bare, never discoverable
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P234"></a>234}</span>
by the onlooker.  Every movement was
simple, direct and natural; every intonation
and inflection true; every word that fell from
her lips clean cut and distinct.  No matter how
rapidly a passage was delivered, she was heard
even to the farthest seat of the largest theatre.
</p>

<p>
"Polly Eccles!  Why, the very thought of
the name makes my face pucker with smiles,
and it must be bordering on fifty years ago
when first she bewitched me in the part!
Yes, 'bewitching Marie Wilton' was a phrase
common amongst us in those days, and in
truth the witchery was there in full measure,
and to overflowing.
</p>

<p>
"Still in my mind is the beautiful farewell
to her on the day when her mortal remains
were laid to rest.  I was very proud at finding
myself one of the four intimate friends chosen
to pay their last respects at her burial; and
when, towards the close of the memorial service
at St. Martin-in-the-Fields which immediately
followed it, that inspired man delivered the
farewell address (quite the most beautiful
of the many I have heard), I was shaken with
a deep emotion even to tears.

I will restrict myself to writing of her in one
play only, and will choose W. S. Gilbert's
dramatic contrast <i>Sweethearts</i>&mdash;which, by the
way, I had the good fortune to name.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P235"></a>235}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
"Sweethearts"
</span>
</p>

<p>
No play of its length has ever excited more
attention than <i>Sweethearts</i>.  Pages could be
filled with the chorus of praise which swelled
from the press.  One leading critic wrote that
Gilbert had determined to test talent by a most
difficult stage exercise; and that my wife
had been able to prove the studied grace and
polished elegance of her dramatic scholarship.
From the subject set to her, called <i>Sweethearts</i>,
she produced the poem of "Jenny."  The
success of the creation was complete.  No
striking or unusually clever writing, no wit, or
epigram, or quaint expression of words, no
telling scene, or passionate speech, taken
separately or in combination, could account
for the impression made by the actress.  The
audience was fascinated by the detail of the
portrait, as charming in youth as it was
beautiful in age.
</p>

<p>
An accomplished judge of acting, well
acquainted with the European stage, after our
retirement from management, said of my wife:
"In my humble opinion, the gem of her
repertoire is <i>Sweethearts</i>, next to that, <i>Masks and
Faces</i> and <i>Caste</i>."  Ellen Terry has written
that her performance in <i>Sweethearts</i> was
unapproachable.
</p>

<p>
More perfect acting, I venture to say, has
not been seen upon our stage.  The <i>ars celare
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P236"></a>236}</span>
artem</i> was at its highest and best; there were
tones and touches, hints and suggestions,
which were marvellous in the wealth of
meaning they conveyed.  Of her acting, indeed, it
might be said, as one of our old poets
proclaimed of the face of his mistress:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'Tis like the milky way i' the sky,<br>
  A meeting of gentle lights without a name!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
I have seen all the finest acting available to
me in the last seventy years&mdash;since my
boyhood&mdash;and still delight in the enjoyment of the
stage.  I can summon noble phantoms from
the past, and dwell gladly upon the experiences
of more recent days.  After searching thought,
the most critical remembrance, I can recall
no acting more perfect, in my judgment, than
my wife's performances in <i>Sweethearts</i>.  The
creatures of the different acts were, from
the first line to the last, absolutely distinct,
but equally complete; the one, a portrait of
impetuous girlhood, the other of calm maturity.
There was not, throughout, one movement of
the body, one tone of the voice, one look on
the speaking face, to change or amend.  There
was nothing, it seemed to me, that could in
any way be bettered.  There shone throughout
those gleams of genius which in all art are
priceless.

<p>
The parts she played upon the stage were the
sweet romance of life, but she was ever ready
to face its stern realities; and I was proud of
her record in the Great War.  In spite of
advanced years and broken health, she lived
through it, with brief absences only, and
without a murmur, on the shore of the sea, with all
its alarms and risks; but, then, I have always
known her to be brave, even when her life
was in danger.  She was unsparing in
hospitality&mdash;I recall an occasion when she had the
pleasant company of General Sir Arthur
Sloggett and Edward Knoblock, who were hung
up with their men for the night at Folkestone&mdash;and
untiring in organising and leading in
amusements, helped by her interest in those
who were spared, and those who were maimed
and wounded, and by the remembrance of
those who rest in the grave-fields of Flanders
and France, or lie deep down under the sea.
</p>

<p>
By her own written request, the hour and
place of her funeral were kept secret, and were
only known to immediate members of her
family and four friends who were chosen to
represent the calling she had loved and served.
These four friends were Arthur Pinero,
Johnston Forbes-Robertson, Arthur Chudleigh and
Gerald du Maurier.
</p>

<p>
The funeral was conducted by her friend and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P238"></a>238}</span>
mine, the Reverend W. H. Elliott, the Vicar
of Holy Trinity, Folkestone, who delivered the
Address at the Memorial Service which,
immediately afterwards, was held at the Church
of St. Martin-in-the-Fields by Canon Edgar
Sheppard.

The spirit of the artist

<p>
This was the address to which Forbes-Robertson
refers in his tribute; and I ask the
reader, as a favour to myself, not to pass it by.
</p>

<p>
"We have come together to remember before
God one who, having played her part bravely
and earnestly in this scene that men call life,
is now hidden from us by the curtain that men
call death.  We do so in the sure and certain
hope that what we know of life here is only
the First Act in a great eternal drama, of the
which the end is not yet.  So often we feel, as
one by one our friends depart in this mystery
of death, that the curtain has fallen upon a tale
that is only half told, its problems unsolved,
its meaning undisclosed, its virtues unrewarded.
But the play is not done.  We wait as Christians
for the hour when, at the sounding of
celestial trumpets, this great curtain shall uproll
once again and reveal to our amazed eyes that
last tremendous scene, in which all things shall
be made new.  Such is death.  It is a pause&mdash;that
is all&mdash;and one that does but make more
wonderful the music of an endless life.
</p>

<p>
"I shall not do more than remind you of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P239"></a>239}</span>
those many gifts which Lady Bancroft possessed,
which the years in their passing seemed
to leave almost untouched, which she offered
so freely for the public good.  After all, the
work and significance of any life depend not
so much upon its natural endowment as upon
the spirit in which that endowment is accepted
and used.  It is the spirit of the artist that
matters, and it is of this in the lifetime of Lady
Bancroft that you are thinking, I know, at
this hour.  Without that eager generous spirit
her influence could never have been what it was.
I have heard her say more than once that in
her youth she was not a very apt pupil in the
use of the voice, and indeed that she made very
little effort in regard to it, until one day her
mother bade her think of the poor man who,
tired out with his day's work, spent a
hard-earned sixpence to see the play, and then went
away disappointed, because he could not hear.
From that moment everything for her was
changed.  And the thought of that man at
the back of the gallery&mdash;what she could do
for him, to make him forget his cares and have
his part in the sunshine and merriment of life,
to take away the frown and to win the smile&mdash;was
for her, I believe, the true motive and the
abiding inspiration of her art.  Such a task,
one cannot but think, is very much according
to the mind of Him who gives the wayside
flower a robe that Solomon might envy, that
we may see it and be glad.  And there are few
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P240"></a>240}</span>
things, I imagine, that bring so much comfort
at the last, when the time has come to retreat
from the active work of the world, and to
reflect quietly in the gathering dusk upon what
has been and what is yet to be, as the thought
that one has done something to make others
happy, that now and again one has managed
to light a lamp or to kindle a fire in a cold and
darksome room, that one has done what one
could in one's own way to share the burdens
of humanity and to minister to its need.
</p>

<p>
"I need scarcely say that one of the secrets
of such a work as this is a heart which, in
spite of all that time and circumstance can
do, keeps young.  The first test of all art is
sincerity.  It is impossible, I should suppose,
to be in any true sense an interpreter of emotions
that one has ceased to feel.  To represent
in any way the vivacity, the buoyancy, the
gaiety that belong to youth, its irrepressible
humour, its unquenchable hope, is a task that
the years make difficult enough for us all.  To
attempt it successfully is only for those who
in themselves have never yet grown old.  Lady
Bancroft was a lover of young life.  She was
beloved by all young people who knew her.
And one felt in talking to her that, as her voice
had kept its magic, so her nature had preserved
within a tired body something of its youth.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The secret of success
</span>
</p>

<p>
"The world saw little of her during these
latter years.  She lived her life in quiet places,
among the trees and flowers in which she
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P241"></a>241}</span>
delighted, within sight and sound of the
ever-changing sea.  During these spring months her
thoughts had dwelt much on that other world
and the mysteries that await us there.  She
spoke of it often, and expressed to me more than
once what seemed rather a curious wish&mdash;curious
because one so rarely meets it&mdash;to sit at
a table with learned divines, as she called them,
and to hear them discuss together the great
matters of God and man, life and death, things
present and things to come.  She had a most
intense desire to know better that Power that
holds us and shapes our ends.  She wanted to
see His work more plainly that she might adore
Him more perfectly.  She longed to discern
His will that she might do it with a ready heart.
And, as she talked of all this, deep reverence
and great wistfulness came into her voice.
She wished so much to understand.  Well, she
has passed through the Valley now.  She has
climbed above the mists that hang so closely
around human life.  She has come out into
the light&mdash;the light that never was on sea or
land&mdash;before which all the shadows flee away.
</p>

<p>
"So we think of her, so we give thanks for
her to-day.  Men differ much in their ideas of
success.  For myself, there is one definition
that I like very much: 'He has achieved
success who has lived long, laughed often, and
loved much; who has gained the respect of
intelligent men and the affection of little
children; who has filled his niche and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P242"></a>242}</span>
accomplished his task; who has left the world a little
better than he found it, whether by an improved
poppy or by a perfect poem or by a saintly
soul; who was looking always for the best in
others, and was trying always to give the best
he had.' So much of that is true of her whom
we commemorate.  And we follow her now
with our earnest prayers into that state of
life into which it has pleased God to call her."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
After the end many treasured letters came
to me about her.  One was written by the
Queen, and sent to me by hand; my wife for
many years had been given the honour of
writing direct to Her Majesty.
</p>

<p>
From all the letters I will only quote a few
words written by a friend:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Your loss is indeed great, and the world is
poorer by the loss of a brilliant personality.
Nobody has ever given greater pleasure to
thousands and thousands than she did.  Let
me tell you a little incident.  The first time
you and Lady Bancroft came to us in Belgrave
Square was one day when my mother was alive;
she died forty years ago, so you will not
recollect it.  At the time she was very ill, very
depressed, and scarcely ever smiled.  After
you and your wife left, my mother turned to
me and said: 'What a wonderful woman!
She has made my sad heart like a bright
garden.'"
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P243"></a>243}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
"Mary's Place"
</span>
</p>

<p>
I will end by telling of an episode which
occurred on the day the old Prince of Wales's
Theatre was launched on its eventful career,
which, as it happily chanced, was a success
from start to finish.  The incidents may have
interest for the superstitious and afford
amusement to the sceptic.  My wife's mother was
too nervous to attend the first performance,
and a married daughter took her for a country
drive to distract her anxious thoughts.  They
followed the road leading to Willesden, then
quite rural.  All kinds of subjects were begun,
to no purpose; the mother's mind was in
the little theatre.  "Mary"&mdash;my wife was
christened Marie, but Mrs. Wilton called her
Mary&mdash;"has always been so fortunate; she
seems to have lived a charmed life, but her
luck may desert her now, and I am always
wondering and dreaming, Emma, what may
be the end of this brave but dangerous
enterprise."  As the words left the mother's lips
a corner in the road was reached, and suddenly
their eyes encountered a little block of stone
with an inscription upon it let into the wall of
a row of humble houses facing them.  The
inscription was: "Mary's Place, Fortune
Gate."  It seemed like an answer, a prophecy,
and it comforted Mrs. Wilton's anxious
wonderings.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P244"></a>244}</span>
</p>

<p>
Later on, we often drove in that direction,
to look at what became known to us as "The
Stone of Destiny," and when, more than
twenty years afterwards, the story appeared in
print, we received a letter informing us that
the little row was about to be pulled down to
make room for larger and better houses to be
built in their place.  The letter came from one
interested in the property&mdash;a Mr. Bennett&mdash;who
kindly asked if we would accept the "talisman";
and he afterwards left it at our door.
The stone was taken by us from one home to
another; it is now let into the wall of the
mausoleum I built for my wife in Brompton
Cemetery, where all that is left of her in this
world is at rest and where there is room
for me.
